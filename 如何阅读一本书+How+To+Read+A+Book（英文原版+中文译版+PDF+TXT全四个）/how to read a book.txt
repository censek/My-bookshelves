HOW TO READ A BOOK 
A Guide to Reading the Great Books 
by Mortimer J. Adler 
Preface 
---- 
In this special edition of How to read a Book, I can make clear what was not entirely 
clear when the book was first published in 1940. Readers of the book knew, though its 
title did not indicate this with complete accuracy, that the subject was not how to read 
any book, but how to read a great book. In 1940 the time was not yet ripe for such a 
title, with which the book might not have reached the large audience that it did. Today, 
with hundreds of thousands of American families engaged in reading and discussing the 
great gooks ！ books that alone require the kind of reading described ！ the situation is 
much changed. I have therefore added a new subtitle for this edition: A guide to Reading 
the Great Books. 
How to Read a Book attempts to inculcate skills that are useful for reading anything. 
These skills, however, are more than merely useful！they are necessary！for the 
reading of great books, those that are of enduring interest and importance. Although one 
can read books, magazines, and newspapers of transient interest without these skills, the 
possession of them enables the reader to read even the transient with greater speed, 
precision, and discrimination. The are of reading analytically, interpretively, and 
critically is indispensable only for the kind of reading by which the mind passes form a 
state of understanding less to a state of understanding more, and for reading the few 
books that are capable of being read with increasing profit over and over again. those 
few books are the great books！and the rules of reading here set forth are the rules for 
reading them. The illustrations that I have given to guide the reader in applying the rules 
all refer to the great books. 
When this book was written, it was based on twenty years of experience in reading and 
discussing the great books！at Columbia University, at the University of Chicago, and 
St. John's College in Annapolis, as well as with a number of adult groups. Since then the 
number of adult groups has multiplied by the thousands; since then many more colleges 
and universities, as well as secondary schools all over the country, have introduced 
courses devoted to reading and discussing the great books, for they have come to be 
recognized as the core of a liberal and humanistic education. But, though these are all 
advances in American education for which we have good reason to be grateful, the most 
important educational event since 1940 has been, in my judgment, the publication and 
distribution by Encyclopedia Britanica, Incorporated, of Great Books of the Western 
World, which has brought the great books into hundreds of thousands of American 
homes, and into almost every public and school library. 
To celebrate the fact, this new edition of How to Read a Book carries a new Appendix 
that lists the contents of Great Books of the Western World; and also, accordingly, a 
revised version of Chapter Sixteen. Turn to page 373 and you will find the great books 
listed there into four main groups: imaginative literature (poetry, fiction, and drama); 
history and social science; natural science and mathematics; philosophy and theology. 
Since 1952, when Great Books of the Western World was published, Encyclopedia 
Britannica has added a companion set of books, consisting of shorter masterpieces in all 
fields of literature and learning, properly entitled Gateway to the Great Books. You will 
find the contents of this set also listed in the Appendix, beginning on page 379. 
The present book is, as its subtitle indicates, a guide to reading the things that most 
deserve careful reading and rereading, and that is why I recommend it to anyone who 
owns Great Books of the Western World and Gateway to the Great Books. But the 

owner of these sets has other tools at hand to help him. The Syntopicon, comprising 
Volumes 2 and 3 of Great Books of the Western World, is a different kind of guide to 
reading. How to Read a Book is intended to help the reader read a single great book 
through cover to cover. The Syntopicon helps the reader read through the whole 
collection of great books by reading what they have to say on any one of three thousand 
topics of general human interest, organized under 102 great ideas. (You will find the 
102 great ideas listed on the jacket of this book.) Volume I of Gateway to the Great 
Books contains a Syntopical Guide that serves a similar purpose for that set of shorter 
masterpieces. 
One other Britannica publication deserves brief mention here. Unlike each year's best-
sellers that are out of date one year later, the great books are the perennials of 
literature！relevant to the problems that human beings face in every year of every 
century. That is the way they should be read！for the light they throw upon human life 
and human society, past, present, and future. And that is why Britannica publishes an 
annual volume, entitled The Great Ideas Today, the aim of which is to illustrate the 
striking relevance of the great books and the great ideas to contemporary events and 
issues, and to the latest advances in the arts and sciences. 
With all these aids to reading and to understanding, the accumulated wisdom of our 
Western civilization is within the reach of anyone who has the willingness to put them 
to good use.

THE ACTIVITY OF READING 
 
 CHAPTER ONE 
To the Average Reader 
 - 1 - 
This is a book for readers who cannot read. They may sound rude, though I do not mean 
to be. It may sound like a contradiction, but it is not. The appearance of rudeness and 
contradiction arises only from the variety of senses in which the word "reading" can be 
used. 
The reader who has read thus far surely can read, in some sense of the word. You can 
guess, therefore, what I must mean. It is that this book is intended for those who can 
read in some sense of "reading" but not in others. There are many kinds of reading and 
degrees of ability to read. It is not contradictory to say that this book is for readers who 
want to read better or want to read in some other way than they now can. 
For whom is this book not intended, then? I can answer that question simply by naming 
the two extreme cases. There are those who cannot read at all or in any way.: Infants, 
imbeciles, and other innocents. And there may be those who are masters of the art of 
reading！who can do every sort of reading and do it as well as is humanly possible. 
Most authors would like nothing better than such persons to write for. But a book, such 
as this, which is concerned with the art of reading itself and which aims to help its 
readers read better, cannot solicit the attention of the already expert. 
Between these two extremes we find the average reader, and that means most of us who 
have learned our ABC's. We have been started on the road to literacy. But most of us 
also know that we are not expert readers. We know this in many ways, but most 
obviously when we find from some things too difficult to read, or have great trouble in 
reading them; or when someone else has read the same thing we have and shown us 
how much we missed or misunderstood. 
If you have not had experiences of this sort, if you have never felt the effort of reading 
or known the frustration when all the effort you could summon was not equal to the 
task, I do not know how to interest you in the problem. Most of us, however, have 
experienced difficulties in reading, but we do not know why we have trouble or what to 
do about it. 
I think this is because most of us do not regard reading as a complicated activity, 
involving many different steps in each of which we can acquire more and more skill 
through practice, as in the case of any other art. We may not even think there is an art of 
reading. We tend to think of reading almost as if it were something as simple and 
natural to do as looking or walking. There is no art of looking or walking. 
Last summer, while I was writing this book, a young man visited me, He had heard 
what I was doing, and he came to ask a favor. Would I tell him how to improve his 
reading? He obviously expected me to answer the question in a few sentences. More 

than that, he appeared to think that once he had learned the simple prescription, success 
would be just around the corner. 
I tried to explain that it was not so simple. It took many pages of this book, I said, to 
discuss the various rules of reading and to show how they should be followed. I told 
him that this book was like a book how to play tennis. As written about in books, the art 
of tennis consists of rules for manage each of the various strokes, a discussion of how 
and when to use them, and a description of how to organize these parts into the general 
strategy of a successful game. The art of reading has to be written about in the same 
way. There are rules for each of the different steps you must take to complete the 
reading of a whole book. 
He seemed a little dubious. Although he suspected that he did not know how to read, he 
also seemed to feel that there could not be so much to learn. The young man was a 
musician. I asked him whether most people, who can hear the sounds, know how to 
listen to a symphony. His reply was, of course not. I confessed I was one of them, and 
asked whether he could tell me how to listen to music as a musician expected it to he 
heard. Of course he could, but not in a few words. Listening to a symphony was a 
complicated affair. You not only had to keep awake, but there were so many different 
things to attend to, so many parts of it to distinguish and relate. He could not tell me 
briefly all that I would have to know. Furthermore, I would have to spend a lot of time 
listening to music to become a skilled auditor. 
Well, I said, the case of reading was similar, If I could learn to hear music, he could 
learn to read a book, but only on the same conditions. Knowing how to read a book well 
was like any other art or skill. There were rules to learn and to follow. Through practice 
good habits must be formed. There were no insurmountable difficulties about it. Only 
willingness to learn and patience in the process were required. 
I do not know whether my answer fully satisfied him. If it didn't, there was one 
difficulty in the way of his learning to read. He did not yet appreciate what reading 
involved. Because he still regarded reading as something almost anyone can do, 
something learned in the primary grades, he may have doubted still that learning to read 
was just like learning to hear music, to play tennis, or become expert in any other 
complex use of one's senses and one's mind. 
The difficulty is, I fear, one that most of us share. That is why I am going to devote the 
first part of this book to explaining the kind of activity reading is. For unless you 
appreciate what is involved, you will not be prepared (as this young man was not when 
he came to see me) for the kind of instruction that is necessary. 
I shall assume, of course, that you want to learn. My help can go no further than you 
will help yourself. No one can make you learn more of an art than you want to learn or 
think you need. People often say that they would try to read if they only knew how. As a 
matter of fact, they might learn how if they would only try. And try they would, if they 
wanted to learn. 
 - 2 - 
I did not discover I could not read until after I had left college. I found it out only after I 
tried to teach others how to read. Most parents have probably made a similar discovery 
by trying to teach their youngsters. Paradoxically, as a result, the parents usually learn 
more about reading than their children. The reason is simple. They have to be more 
active about the business. Anyone who teaches anything has to. 

To get back to my story. So far as the registrar's records were concerned, I was one of 
the satisfactory students in my day at Columbia. We passed courses with creditable 
marks. The game was easy enough, once you caught on to the tricks. If anyone had told 
us then that we did not know much or could not read very well, we would have been 
shocked. We were sure we could listen to lectures and read the books assigned in such 
a way we could answer examination questions neatly. That was the proof of our ability. 
Some of us took one course which increased our self-satisfaction enormously. I had just 
been started by John Erskine. It ran for two years, was called General Honors, and was 
open to a select group of juniors and seniors. It consisted of nothing but "reading" the 
great books, from the Greek classics through the Latin and medieval masterpieces right 
down to the best books of yesterday, William James, Einstein, and Freud. The books 
were in all fields: they were histories and books of science or philosophy, dramatic 
poetry and novels. We discussed them with our teachers one night a week in informal, 
seminar fashion. 
That course had two effects on me. For one thing, it made me think I had struck 
educational gold for the first time. Here was real stuff, handled in a real way, compared 
to the textbook and lecture courses that merely made demands on one's memory. But the 
trouble was I not only thought I had struck gold; I also thought that I owned the mine. 
Here were the great books. I knew how to read. The world was my oyster. 
If, after graduation, I had gone into business or medicine or law, I would probably still 
be harboring the conceit that I knew how to read and was well read beyond the ordinary. 
Fortunately, something woke me form this dream. For every illusion that the classroom 
can nourish, there is a school of hard knocks to destroy it. A few years of practice 
awaken the lawyer and the doctor. Business or newspaper work disillusions the boy who 
thought he was a trader or a reporter when he finished the school of commerce or 
journalism. Well, I thought I was liberally educated, that I knew how to read, and had 
read a lot. The cure for that was teaching, and the punishment that precisely fitted my 
crime was to having to teach, the year after I graduated, in this very Honors course 
which had so inflated me. 
As a student, I had read all the books I was now going to teach but, being very young 
and conscientious, I decided to read them again- you know, just to brush up each week 
for class. To my growing amazement, week after week, I discovered that the books were 
almost brand new to me. I seemed to be reading them for the first time, these books 
which I thought I had "mastered" thoroughly. 
As time went on, I found out not only that I did not know very much about any of these 
books, but also that I did not know how to read them very well. To make up for my 
ignorance and incompetence I did what any young teacher might do who was afraid of 
both his students and his job. I used secondary sources, encyclopedias, commentaries, 
all sorts of books about books about these books. In that way, I thought, I would appear 
to know more than the students. They wouldn't be able to tell that my questions or 
points did not come from my better reading of the book they too were working on. 
Fortunately for me I was found out, or else I might have been satisfied with getting by 
as a teaching just as I had got by as a student. If I had succeeded in fooling others, I 
might soon have deceived myself as well. My first good fortune was in having as a 
colleague in this teaching Mark Van Doren, the poet. He led off in the discussion of 
poetry, as I was supposed to do in the case of history, science, and philosophy. He was 
several years my senior, probably more honest than I, certainly a better reader. Forced 

to compare my performance with his, I simply could not fool myself. I had not found 
out what the books contained by reading them, but by reading about them. 
My questions about a book were of the sort anyone could ask or answer without having 
read the book！anyone who had had recourse to the discussion which a hundred 
secondary sources provide for those who cannot or do not want to read. In contrast, his 
questions seemed to arise from the pages of the book itself. He actually seemed to have 
some intimacy with the author. Each book was a large world, infinitely rich for 
exploration, and woe to the student who answered questions as if, instead of traveling 
therein, he had been listening to a travelogue. The contrast was too plain, and too much 
for me. I was not allowed to forget that I did not know to read. 
My second good fortune lay in the particular group of students who formed that first 
class. They were not long in catching on to me. They knew how to use the 
encyclopedia, or a commentary, or the editor's introduction which usually graces the 
publication of a classic, just as well as I did. One of them, who has since achieved fame 
as a critic, was particularly obstreperous. He took what seemed to me endless delight in 
discussing the various about the book, which could be obtained from secondary sources, 
always to show me and the rest of the class that the book itself still remained to be 
discussed. I do not mean that he or the other students could read the book better than I, 
or had done so. Clearly none of us, with the exception of Mr. Van Doren, was doing the 
job of reading. 
After the first year of teaching, I had few illusions left about my literacy. Since then, I 
have been teaching students how to read books, six years at Columbia with Mark Van 
Doren and for the last ten years at the University of Chicago with President Robert M. 
Hutchins. In the course of years, I think I have gradually learned to read a little better. 
There is no longer any danger of self-deception, of supposing that I have become expert. 
Why? Because reading the same books year after year, I discover each time what I 
found out the first year I began to teach: the book I am rereading is almost new to me. 
For a while, each time I reread it, that I had really read it well at last, only to have the 
next reading show up my inadequacies and misinterpretations. After this happens 
several times, even the dullest of us is likely to learn that perfect reading lies at the end 
of the rainbow. Although practice makes perfect, in this art of reading as in any other, 
the long run needed to prove the maxim is longer than the allotted span. 
 - 3 - 
I am torn between two impulses. I certainly want to encourage you to undertake this 
business of learning to read, but I do not want to fool you by saying that it is quite easy 
or that it can be done in a short time. I am sure you do not want to be fooled. As in the 
case of every other skill, learning to read well presents difficulties to be overcome by 
effort and time. Anyone who undertakes anything is prepared for that, I think, and 
knows that the achievement seldom exceeds the effort. After all, it takes time and 
trouble to grow up from the cradle, to make a fortune, raise a family, or gain the wisdom 
that some old men have. Why should it not take time and trouble to learn to read and to 
read what is worth reading? 
Of course, it would not take so long if we got started when we were in school. 
Unfortunately, almost the opposite happens: one gets stopped. I shall discuss the failure 
of the schools more fully later. Here I wish only to record this fact about our schools, a 
fact which concerns us all, because in large part they have made us what we are today！
people who cannot read well enough to enjoy reading for profit or profit by reading for 
emjoyment. 

But education does not stop with schooling, nor does the responsibility for the ultimate 
educatiional fate of each of us rest entirely on the school system. Everyone can and 
must decide for himself whether he is satisfied with the education he got, or is now 
getting if he is still in school. If he is not satisfied, it is up to him to do something about 
it. With schools as they are, more schooling is hardly the remedy. One weay out！
perhaps the onlyone available to most people！is to learn to read better, and then, by 
reading better, to learn more of what can be learned through reading. 
The way out and how to take it is what this book tries to show. It is for adults who have 
gradually become aware of how little they got from all their schooling, as well as for 
those who, lacking such opportunities, have been puzzled to know how to overcome a 
derprivation they need not to regret too much. It is for student in shool and college who 
may occasionally wonder how to help themselves to education. It is even for teachers 
who may sometimes realize that they are not giving all the help they should, and that 
maybe they do not know how. 
When I think of this large potential audience as the average reader, I am not neglecting 
all the differences in training and ability, in schooling or experience, and certainly not 
the different degrees of interest or sorts of motivation which can be brought to this 
common task. But what is of primary importance is that all of us share a recognition of 
the task and its worth. 
We may be engaged in occupations which do not require us to read for a living, but we 
may still feel that that living would be graded, in its moments of leisure, by some 
learning！the sort we can do by ourselves through reading. We may be professionally 
occupied with matters that demand a kind of technical reading in the course of our 
work: the physician has to keep up with the medical literature; the lawyer never stops 
reading cases; the businessman has to read financial statements, insurance policies, 
contracts, and so forth. No matter whether the reading is to learn or to earn, it can be 
done poorly or well. 
We may be college students！perhaps candidates for a higher degree！and yet realize 
that what is happening to us is stuffing, not education. There are many college students 
who know, certainly by the time they get their bachelor's degree, that they spent four 
years taking courses and finishing with them by passing examinations. The mastery 
attained in that process is not of subject matter, but of the teacher's personality. If the 
student remembers enough of what was told to him in lectures and textbooks, and if he 
has a line on the teacher's pet prejudices, he can pass the course easily enough. but he is 
also passing up an education. 
We may be teachers in some school, college, or university. I hope that most of us 
teachers know we are not expert readers. I hope we know, not merely that our students 
can not read well, but also that we cannot do much better. Every profession has a certain 
amount of humbug about it necessary for impressing the laymen or the clients to be 
served. The humbug we teachers have to practice is the front we put on of knowledge 
and expertness. It is not entirely humbug, because we usually know a little more and can 
do a little better than our best students. But we must not let the humbug fool ourselves. 
If we do not know that our students cannot read very well, we are worse than humbugs: 
we do not our business at all. And if we do not know that we cannot read very much 
better than they, we have allowed our professional imposture to deceive ourselves. 
Just as the best doctors are those who can somehow retain the patient's confidence not 
by hiding but by confessing their limitations, so the best teachers are those who make 
the fewest pretensions. If the students are on all fours with a difficult problem, the 

teacher who shows that he is only crawling also, helps them much more than the 
pedagogue who appears to fly in maginficient circles far above their heads.Perhaps, if 
we teachers were more honest about our own reading disabilities, less loath to reveal 
how hard it is for us to read and how often we fumble, we might get the students interest 
in the game of learning instead of the game of passing. 
 - 4 - 
I trust I have said enough to indicate to readers who cannot read that I am one who 
cannot read much better than they. My chief advantage is the clarity with which I know 
that I cannot, and perhaps why I cannot. That is the best fruit of years of experience in 
trying to teach others. Of course, if I am just a little better than someone else, I can help 
him somewhat. Although none of us can read well enough to satisfy ourselves, we may 
be able to read better than someone else. Although few of us read well for the most 
part, each of us may do a good job of reading in some particular connection, when the 
stakes are high enough to compel the rare exertion. 
The student who is generally superficial may, for a special reason, read some one thing 
well. Scholars who are as superficial as the rest of us in most of their reading often do a 
careful job when the text is in their own narrow field, especially if their reputations hang 
on what they say. On cases relevant to his practice, a lawyer is likely to read 
analytically. A physician may similarly read clinical reports which describe symptoms 
he is currently concerned with. But both these learned men may make similar effort in 
other fields or at other times. Even business assumes the air of a learned profession 
when its devotees are called upon to examine financial statements or contracts, though I 
have heard it said that many businessmen cannot read these documents intelligently 
even when their fortunes are at stake. 
If we consider men and women generally, and apart from their professions or 
occupations, there is only one situation I can think of in which they almost pull 
themselves up by their bootstraps, making an effort to read better than they usually do. 
When they are in love and are reading a love letter, they read between the lines and in 
the margins; they read the whole in terms of the parts, and each part in terms of the 
whole; they grow sensitive to context and ambiguity, to insinuation and implication; 
they perceive the color of words, the odor of phrases, and the weight of sentences.They 
may even take the punctuation into account. Then, if never before or after, they read. 
These examples, especially the last, are enough to suggest a first approximation of what 
I mean by "reading." That is not enough, however. What this is all about can be more 
accurately understood only if the different kinds and grades of reading are more 
definitely distinguished. To read this book intelligently！which is what this book aims 
to help its readers do with all books！such distinctions must be grasped. that belongs to 
the next chapter. Here suffice it if it is understood that this book is not about reading in 
every sense but only about that kind of reading which its readers do not do well enough, 
or at all, except when they are in love 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER TWO 
The Reading of "Reading" 
 - 1 - 
 One of the primary rules for reading anything is to spot the most important words the 
author uses. Spotting them is not enough, however. You have to know how they are 
being used. Finding an important word merely begins the more difficult research for the 
meanings, one or more, common or special, which the word is used to convey as it 
appears here and there in the text. 
You already know "reading" is one of the most important words in this book. But, as I 
have already sugggested, it is a word of many meanings. If you take for granted that you 
know what I mean by the word, we are likely to get into difficulties before we proceed 
much further. 
This business of using language to talk about language！specially if one is campaigning 
against its abuse！is risky. Recently Mr. Stuart Chase wrote a book which he should 
have called Words bout Words. He might then have avoided the barb of the critics who 
so quickly pointed out that Mr. Chase himself was subject to the tyranny of word. Mr. 
Chase recognized the peril when he said , "I shall frequently be caught in my own trap 
by using bad language in a plea for better." 
Can I avoid such pitfalls? I am writing about reading and so it would appear that I do 
not have to obey the rules of reading but of writing. My escape may be more apparrent 
than real, if it turns out that a writer should keep in mind the rules which govern 
reading. You, however, are reading about reading. You cannot escape. If the reules of 
reading I am going to suggest are sound, you must follow them in reading this book. 
But, you will say, how can we follow the rules until we learn and understand them? To 
do that we shall have to read some part of this book without knowing what the rules are. 
The only way I know to help out of this dilemma is by making you reading-conscious 
readers as we proceed. Let us start at once by applying the rule about find and 
interpreting the important words. 
 - 2 - 
When you start out to investigate the various senses of a word, it is usually wise to 
begin with a dictionary and your own knowledge of common usage. If you looked up 
"read" in the large Oxford Dictionary, you would find, first, that the same four letters 
constituted an obsolete noun referring to the fourth stomach of a ruminant, and the 
commonly used verb which refers to a mental activity involving words or symbols of 
some sort. You would know at once that we need not bother with the obsolete noun 
except, perhaps, to note that reading has something to do with rumination. You would 
discover next that the verb has twenty-one more or less closely related meanings, more 
or less common. 
One uncommon meaning of "to read" is to think or suppose. This meaning passes into 
the more usual one of conjecturing or predicting, as when we speak of reading the stars, 
one's prm, or one's future. That leads eventually to the meaning of the word in which it 
refers to perusing books or other written documents. There are many other meanings, 
such as verbal utterance ( when an actress reads her lines for the director); such as 
detecting what is not perceptible from what is (when we asy we can read a person's 

character in his face); such as instruction, academic or personal (when we have someone 
read us a lecture). 
The slight variations in usage seem endless; a singer reads music; a scientist reads 
nature; an engineer reads his instruments; a printer reads proof; we read between the 
lines; we read something into situation, or someone out of the party. 
We can simplify matters by noting what is common to many of these senses; namely, 
that mental activity is involved and that, in one way or another, symbols are being 
interpreted. That imposes a first limitation on our use of the word. We are not concerned 
with a part of the intestinal tract, nor are we concerned with enunciation, with speaking 
something out loud. A second limitation is need, because we shall not consider！except 
for some points of comparison！the interpretation, clairvoyant or otherwise, of natural 
signs such as stars hands, or faces. We shall limit ourselves to one kind of readable 
symbol, the kind which men invent for the purposes of communication！the words of 
human language. This eliminates the reading of other artificial signs such as the pointers 
on dials of physical apparatus, thermometers, gauges, speedometers, and so forth. 
Henceforth, then, you must read the word "reading," as it occurs in this text, to refer to 
the process of interpreting or understanding what presents itself to the senses in the form 
of words or other sensible marks. This is not arbitrary legislation about what the word 
"reading" means. It is simply a matter of defining our problem, which reading the in the 
sense of receiving communication. 
Unfortunately, that is not simple do do, as you would realize at once if someone asked: 
"What about listening? Isn't that receiving communication, too?" I shall subsquently 
discuss the relation of reading and listening, for the rules of good reading are for the 
most part the rules of good listening, though perhaps harder to apply in the latter case. 
Suffice it for the present to distinguish reading from listening by restricting the 
communication being received to what is written and printed rather than spoken. 
I shall try to use the word "reading" in the limited and special sense noted. But I know 
that I will not succeed without exception. It will be impossible to avoid using the word 
in some of its other senses. Sometimes I sha;; be thoughtful enough to mention 
explicitly that I am shifting the meaning. Other times I may suppose that the context is 
sufficient warning to you. Infrequently ( I hope ) I may shift the meaning without being 
aware of it myself. 
Be stout, gentle reader, for you are just beginning. What has gone before is just 
preliminary to finding out the even narrower sense in which the word "reading" will be 
used. We must now face the problem which the first chapter indicated. We must 
distinguish between the sense in which you can read this book, for instance, and are 
now doing so, and the sense in which you may learn from it to read better or diferently 
than you now can. 
Notice that I said "better" or "differently." The one word points to diffrence in degrees 
of ability, the other to a distinction in kinds. I suppose we shall find that the better 
reader can also do a different kind of reading. The poorer can probably do only one 
kind！the simplest kind. Let us first examine the range of ability in reading to 
determine what we mean by "better" and "poorer." 

- 3 - 
One obvious fact shows the existence of a wide range of degrees in ability to read. It is 
that reading begins in the primary grades and runs through every level of the 
educational system. Reading is the first of the three R's. It is first because we have to 
learn to read in order to learn by reading. Since what we have to learn, as we ascend in 
our education, becomes more difficult or complex, we must improve our ability to read 
proportionately. 
Literacy is everywhere the primary mark of education, but it has many degrees, from a 
grammar-school diploma, or even less, up to a bachelor's degree or a Ph.D. But, in his 
recent commentary on American democracy, called Of Human Fredom, Jacques Barzun 
cautions us not to be misled by the boast that we have the most literate population in the 
world. "Literacy in this sense is not education; it is not even 'knowing how to read' in 
the sense of taking in quickly and correctly the message of the printed page, to say 
nothing of exercising a critical judgement upon it." 
Supposedly, gradations in reading go along with graduations from one educational 
level to another. In the light of what we know about American education today, that 
supposition is not well founded. In France it is still true that the candidate for the 
doctor's degree must show an ability to read sufficient to admit him to that higher circle 
of literacy. What the French call explication de texte is an art which must be practiced at 
every educational level and in which improvement must be made before one moves up 
the scale. But in this country there is often little discenible difference between the 
explication which a high-school student would give and one by a college senior or even 
a doctoral candidate. When the task is to read a book, the high-school students and 
college freshmen are often better, if only because they are less thoroughly spoiled by 
bad habits. 
The fact that there ie something wrong with American education, so far as reading is 
concerned, means only that the gradations have become obscure for us, not that theydo 
not exist. Our task is to remove that obscurity. To make the distinction in grades of 
reading sharper, we must define the criteria of better and worse. 
What are the criteria? I think I have already suggested what they are, in the previous 
chapter. Thus, we say that one man is a better reader than another if he can read more 
difficult material. Anyone would agree, if Jones is able to read only such things as 
newspaper and magazines, whereas Brown can read the best current nonfiction books, 
such as Einstein and Infeld's Evolution of Physics or Hoben's Mathematics for the 
Millions, that Brown has more ability than Jones. Among readers at the Jones level, 

HOW TO READ A BOOK 
A Guide to Reading the Great Books 
by Mortimer J. Adler 
Preface 
---- 
In this special edition of How to read a Book, I can make clear what was not entirely 
clear when the book was first published in 1940. Readers of the book knew, though its 
title did not indicate this with complete accuracy, that the subject was not how to read 
any book, but how to read a great book. In 1940 the time was not yet ripe for such a 
title, with which the book might not have reached the large audience that it did. Today, 
with hundreds of thousands of American families engaged in reading and discussing the 
great gooks ！ books that alone require the kind of reading described ！ the situation is 
much changed. I have therefore added a new subtitle for this edition: A guide to Reading 
the Great Books. 
How to Read a Book attempts to inculcate skills that are useful for reading anything. 
These skills, however, are more than merely useful！they are necessary！for the 
reading of great books, those that are of enduring interest and importance. Although one 
can read books, magazines, and newspapers of transient interest without these skills, the 
possession of them enables the reader to read even the transient with greater speed, 
precision, and discrimination. The are of reading analytically, interpretively, and 
critically is indispensable only for the kind of reading by which the mind passes form a 
state of understanding less to a state of understanding more, and for reading the few 
books that are capable of being read with increasing profit over and over again. those 
few books are the great books！and the rules of reading here set forth are the rules for 
reading them. The illustrations that I have given to guide the reader in applying the rules 
all refer to the great books. 
When this book was written, it was based on twenty years of experience in reading and 
discussing the great books！at Columbia University, at the University of Chicago, and 
St. John's College in Annapolis, as well as with a number of adult groups. Since then the 
number of adult groups has multiplied by the thousands; since then many more colleges 
and universities, as well as secondary schools all over the country, have introduced 
courses devoted to reading and discussing the great books, for they have come to be 
recognized as the core of a liberal and humanistic education. But, though these are all 
advances in American education for which we have good reason to be grateful, the most 
important educational event since 1940 has been, in my judgment, the publication and 
distribution by Encyclopedia Britanica, Incorporated, of Great Books of the Western 
World, which has brought the great books into hundreds of thousands of American 
homes, and into almost every public and school library. 
To celebrate the fact, this new edition of How to Read a Book carries a new Appendix 
that lists the contents of Great Books of the Western World; and also, accordingly, a 
revised version of Chapter Sixteen. Turn to page 373 and you will find the great books 
listed there into four main groups: imaginative literature (poetry, fiction, and drama); 
history and social science; natural science and mathematics; philosophy and theology. 
Since 1952, when Great Books of the Western World was published, Encyclopedia 
Britannica has added a companion set of books, consisting of shorter masterpieces in all 
fields of literature and learning, properly entitled Gateway to the Great Books. You will 
find the contents of this set also listed in the Appendix, beginning on page 379. 
The present book is, as its subtitle indicates, a guide to reading the things that most 
deserve careful reading and rereading, and that is why I recommend it to anyone who 
owns Great Books of the Western World and Gateway to the Great Books. But the 

owner of these sets has other tools at hand to help him. The Syntopicon, comprising 
Volumes 2 and 3 of Great Books of the Western World, is a different kind of guide to 
reading. How to Read a Book is intended to help the reader read a single great book 
through cover to cover. The Syntopicon helps the reader read through the whole 
collection of great books by reading what they have to say on any one of three thousand 
topics of general human interest, organized under 102 great ideas. (You will find the 
102 great ideas listed on the jacket of this book.) Volume I of Gateway to the Great 
Books contains a Syntopical Guide that serves a similar purpose for that set of shorter 
masterpieces. 
One other Britannica publication deserves brief mention here. Unlike each year's best-
sellers that are out of date one year later, the great books are the perennials of 
literature！relevant to the problems that human beings face in every year of every 
century. That is the way they should be read！for the light they throw upon human life 
and human society, past, present, and future. And that is why Britannica publishes an 
annual volume, entitled The Great Ideas Today, the aim of which is to illustrate the 
striking relevance of the great books and the great ideas to contemporary events and 
issues, and to the latest advances in the arts and sciences. 
With all these aids to reading and to understanding, the accumulated wisdom of our 
Western civilization is within the reach of anyone who has the willingness to put them 
to good use.

PART I . 
 
THE ACTIVITY OF READING 
 
 CHAPTER ONE 
To the Average Reader 
 - 1 - 
This is a book for readers who cannot read. They may sound rude, though I do not mean 
to be. It may sound like a contradiction, but it is not. The appearance of rudeness and 
contradiction arises only from the variety of senses in which the word "reading" can be 
used. 
The reader who has read thus far surely can read, in some sense of the word. You can 
guess, therefore, what I must mean. It is that this book is intended for those who can 
read in some sense of "reading" but not in others. There are many kinds of reading and 
degrees of ability to read. It is not contradictory to say that this book is for readers who 
want to read better or want to read in some other way than they now can. 
For whom is this book not intended, then? I can answer that question simply by naming 
the two extreme cases. There are those who cannot read at all or in any way.: Infants, 
imbeciles, and other innocents. And there may be those who are masters of the art of 
reading！who can do every sort of reading and do it as well as is humanly possible. 
Most authors would like nothing better than such persons to write for. But a book, such 
as this, which is concerned with the art of reading itself and which aims to help its 
readers read better, cannot solicit the attention of the already expert. 
Between these two extremes we find the average reader, and that means most of us who 
have learned our ABC's. We have been started on the road to literacy. But most of us 
also know that we are not expert readers. We know this in many ways, but most 
obviously when we find from some things too difficult to read, or have great trouble in 
reading them; or when someone else has read the same thing we have and shown us 
how much we missed or misunderstood. 
If you have not had experiences of this sort, if you have never felt the effort of reading 
or known the frustration when all the effort you could summon was not equal to the 
task, I do not know how to interest you in the problem. Most of us, however, have 
experienced difficulties in reading, but we do not know why we have trouble or what to 
do about it. 
I think this is because most of us do not regard reading as a complicated activity, 
involving many different steps in each of which we can acquire more and more skill 
through practice, as in the case of any other art. We may not even think there is an art of 
reading. We tend to think of reading almost as if it were something as simple and 
natural to do as looking or walking. There is no art of looking or walking. 
Last summer, while I was writing this book, a young man visited me, He had heard 
what I was doing, and he came to ask a favor. Would I tell him how to improve his 
reading? He obviously expected me to answer the question in a few sentences. More 

than that, he appeared to think that once he had learned the simple prescription, success 
would be just around the corner. 
I tried to explain that it was not so simple. It took many pages of this book, I said, to 
discuss the various rules of reading and to show how they should be followed. I told 
him that this book was like a book how to play tennis. As written about in books, the art 
of tennis consists of rules for manage each of the various strokes, a discussion of how 
and when to use them, and a description of how to organize these parts into the general 
strategy of a successful game. The art of reading has to be written about in the same 
way. There are rules for each of the different steps you must take to complete the 
reading of a whole book. 
He seemed a little dubious. Although he suspected that he did not know how to read, he 
also seemed to feel that there could not be so much to learn. The young man was a 
musician. I asked him whether most people, who can hear the sounds, know how to 
listen to a symphony. His reply was, of course not. I confessed I was one of them, and 
asked whether he could tell me how to listen to music as a musician expected it to he 
heard. Of course he could, but not in a few words. Listening to a symphony was a 
complicated affair. You not only had to keep awake, but there were so many different 
things to attend to, so many parts of it to distinguish and relate. He could not tell me 
briefly all that I would have to know. Furthermore, I would have to spend a lot of time 
listening to music to become a skilled auditor. 
Well, I said, the case of reading was similar, If I could learn to hear music, he could 
learn to read a book, but only on the same conditions. Knowing how to read a book well 
was like any other art or skill. There were rules to learn and to follow. Through practice 
good habits must be formed. There were no insurmountable difficulties about it. Only 
willingness to learn and patience in the process were required. 
I do not know whether my answer fully satisfied him. If it didn't, there was one 
difficulty in the way of his learning to read. He did not yet appreciate what reading 
involved. Because he still regarded reading as something almost anyone can do, 
something learned in the primary grades, he may have doubted still that learning to read 
was just like learning to hear music, to play tennis, or become expert in any other 
complex use of one's senses and one's mind. 
The difficulty is, I fear, one that most of us share. That is why I am going to devote the 
first part of this book to explaining the kind of activity reading is. For unless you 
appreciate what is involved, you will not be prepared (as this young man was not when 
he came to see me) for the kind of instruction that is necessary. 
I shall assume, of course, that you want to learn. My help can go no further than you 
will help yourself. No one can make you learn more of an art than you want to learn or 
think you need. People often say that they would try to read if they only knew how. As a 
matter of fact, they might learn how if they would only try. And try they would, if they 
wanted to learn. 
 - 2 - 
I did not discover I could not read until after I had left college. I found it out only after I 
tried to teach others how to read. Most parents have probably made a similar discovery 
by trying to teach their youngsters. Paradoxically, as a result, the parents usually learn 
more about reading than their children. The reason is simple. They have to be more 
active about the business. Anyone who teaches anything has to. 

To get back to my story. So far as the registrar's records were concerned, I was one of 
the satisfactory students in my day at Columbia. We passed courses with creditable 
marks. The game was easy enough, once you caught on to the tricks. If anyone had told 
us then that we did not know much or could not read very well, we would have been 
shocked. We were sure we could listen to lectures and read the books assigned in such 
a way we could answer examination questions neatly. That was the proof of our ability. 
Some of us took one course which increased our self-satisfaction enormously. I had just 
been started by John Erskine. It ran for two years, was called General Honors, and was 
open to a select group of juniors and seniors. It consisted of nothing but "reading" the 
great books, from the Greek classics through the Latin and medieval masterpieces right 
down to the best books of yesterday, William James, Einstein, and Freud. The books 
were in all fields: they were histories and books of science or philosophy, dramatic 
poetry and novels. We discussed them with our teachers one night a week in informal, 
seminar fashion. 
That course had two effects on me. For one thing, it made me think I had struck 
educational gold for the first time. Here was real stuff, handled in a real way, compared 
to the textbook and lecture courses that merely made demands on one's memory. But the 
trouble was I not only thought I had struck gold; I also thought that I owned the mine. 
Here were the great books. I knew how to read. The world was my oyster. 
If, after graduation, I had gone into business or medicine or law, I would probably still 
be harboring the conceit that I knew how to read and was well read beyond the ordinary. 
Fortunately, something woke me form this dream. For every illusion that the classroom 
can nourish, there is a school of hard knocks to destroy it. A few years of practice 
awaken the lawyer and the doctor. Business or newspaper work disillusions the boy who 
thought he was a trader or a reporter when he finished the school of commerce or 
journalism. Well, I thought I was liberally educated, that I knew how to read, and had 
read a lot. The cure for that was teaching, and the punishment that precisely fitted my 
crime was to having to teach, the year after I graduated, in this very Honors course 
which had so inflated me. 
As a student, I had read all the books I was now going to teach but, being very young 
and conscientious, I decided to read them again- you know, just to brush up each week 
for class. To my growing amazement, week after week, I discovered that the books were 
almost brand new to me. I seemed to be reading them for the first time, these books 
which I thought I had "mastered" thoroughly. 
As time went on, I found out not only that I did not know very much about any of these 
books, but also that I did not know how to read them very well. To make up for my 
ignorance and incompetence I did what any young teacher might do who was afraid of 
both his students and his job. I used secondary sources, encyclopedias, commentaries, 
all sorts of books about books about these books. In that way, I thought, I would appear 
to know more than the students. They wouldn't be able to tell that my questions or 
points did not come from my better reading of the book they too were working on. 
Fortunately for me I was found out, or else I might have been satisfied with getting by 
as a teaching just as I had got by as a student. If I had succeeded in fooling others, I 
might soon have deceived myself as well. My first good fortune was in having as a 
colleague in this teaching Mark Van Doren, the poet. He led off in the discussion of 
poetry, as I was supposed to do in the case of history, science, and philosophy. He was 
several years my senior, probably more honest than I, certainly a better reader. Forced 

to compare my performance with his, I simply could not fool myself. I had not found 
out what the books contained by reading them, but by reading about them. 
My questions about a book were of the sort anyone could ask or answer without having 
read the book！anyone who had had recourse to the discussion which a hundred 
secondary sources provide for those who cannot or do not want to read. In contrast, his 
questions seemed to arise from the pages of the book itself. He actually seemed to have 
some intimacy with the author. Each book was a large world, infinitely rich for 
exploration, and woe to the student who answered questions as if, instead of traveling 
therein, he had been listening to a travelogue. The contrast was too plain, and too much 
for me. I was not allowed to forget that I did not know to read. 
My second good fortune lay in the particular group of students who formed that first 
class. They were not long in catching on to me. They knew how to use the 
encyclopedia, or a commentary, or the editor's introduction which usually graces the 
publication of a classic, just as well as I did. One of them, who has since achieved fame 
as a critic, was particularly obstreperous. He took what seemed to me endless delight in 
discussing the various about the book, which could be obtained from secondary sources, 
always to show me and the rest of the class that the book itself still remained to be 
discussed. I do not mean that he or the other students could read the book better than I, 
or had done so. Clearly none of us, with the exception of Mr. Van Doren, was doing the 
job of reading. 
After the first year of teaching, I had few illusions left about my literacy. Since then, I 
have been teaching students how to read books, six years at Columbia with Mark Van 
Doren and for the last ten years at the University of Chicago with President Robert M. 
Hutchins. In the course of years, I think I have gradually learned to read a little better. 
There is no longer any danger of self-deception, of supposing that I have become expert. 
Why? Because reading the same books year after year, I discover each time what I 
found out the first year I began to teach: the book I am rereading is almost new to me. 
For a while, each time I reread it, that I had really read it well at last, only to have the 
next reading show up my inadequacies and misinterpretations. After this happens 
several times, even the dullest of us is likely to learn that perfect reading lies at the end 
of the rainbow. Although practice makes perfect, in this art of reading as in any other, 
the long run needed to prove the maxim is longer than the allotted span. 
 - 3 - 
I am torn between two impulses. I certainly want to encourage you to undertake this 
business of learning to read, but I do not want to fool you by saying that it is quite easy 
or that it can be done in a short time. I am sure you do not want to be fooled. As in the 
case of every other skill, learning to read well presents difficulties to be overcome by 
effort and time. Anyone who undertakes anything is prepared for that, I think, and 
knows that the achievement seldom exceeds the effort. After all, it takes time and 
trouble to grow up from the cradle, to make a fortune, raise a family, or gain the wisdom 
that some old men have. Why should it not take time and trouble to learn to read and to 
read what is worth reading? 
Of course, it would not take so long if we got started when we were in school. 
Unfortunately, almost the opposite happens: one gets stopped. I shall discuss the failure 
of the schools more fully later. Here I wish only to record this fact about our schools, a 
fact which concerns us all, because in large part they have made us what we are today！
people who cannot read well enough to enjoy reading for profit or profit by reading for 
emjoyment. 

But education does not stop with schooling, nor does the responsibility for the ultimate 
educatiional fate of each of us rest entirely on the school system. Everyone can and 
must decide for himself whether he is satisfied with the education he got, or is now 
getting if he is still in school. If he is not satisfied, it is up to him to do something about 
it. With schools as they are, more schooling is hardly the remedy. One weay out！
perhaps the onlyone available to most people！is to learn to read better, and then, by 
reading better, to learn more of what can be learned through reading. 
The way out and how to take it is what this book tries to show. It is for adults who have 
gradually become aware of how little they got from all their schooling, as well as for 
those who, lacking such opportunities, have been puzzled to know how to overcome a 
derprivation they need not to regret too much. It is for student in shool and college who 
may occasionally wonder how to help themselves to education. It is even for teachers 
who may sometimes realize that they are not giving all the help they should, and that 
maybe they do not know how. 
When I think of this large potential audience as the average reader, I am not neglecting 
all the differences in training and ability, in schooling or experience, and certainly not 
the different degrees of interest or sorts of motivation which can be brought to this 
common task. But what is of primary importance is that all of us share a recognition of 
the task and its worth. 
We may be engaged in occupations which do not require us to read for a living, but we 
may still feel that that living would be graded, in its moments of leisure, by some 
learning！the sort we can do by ourselves through reading. We may be professionally 
occupied with matters that demand a kind of technical reading in the course of our 
work: the physician has to keep up with the medical literature; the lawyer never stops 
reading cases; the businessman has to read financial statements, insurance policies, 
contracts, and so forth. No matter whether the reading is to learn or to earn, it can be 
done poorly or well. 
We may be college students！perhaps candidates for a higher degree！and yet realize 
that what is happening to us is stuffing, not education. There are many college students 
who know, certainly by the time they get their bachelor's degree, that they spent four 
years taking courses and finishing with them by passing examinations. The mastery 
attained in that process is not of subject matter, but of the teacher's personality. If the 
student remembers enough of what was told to him in lectures and textbooks, and if he 
has a line on the teacher's pet prejudices, he can pass the course easily enough. but he is 
also passing up an education. 
We may be teachers in some school, college, or university. I hope that most of us 
teachers know we are not expert readers. I hope we know, not merely that our students 
can not read well, but also that we cannot do much better. Every profession has a certain 
amount of humbug about it necessary for impressing the laymen or the clients to be 
served. The humbug we teachers have to practice is the front we put on of knowledge 
and expertness. It is not entirely humbug, because we usually know a little more and can 
do a little better than our best students. But we must not let the humbug fool ourselves. 
If we do not know that our students cannot read very well, we are worse than humbugs: 
we do not our business at all. And if we do not know that we cannot read very much 
better than they, we have allowed our professional imposture to deceive ourselves. 
Just as the best doctors are those who can somehow retain the patient's confidence not 
by hiding but by confessing their limitations, so the best teachers are those who make 
the fewest pretensions. If the students are on all fours with a difficult problem, the 

teacher who shows that he is only crawling also, helps them much more than the 
pedagogue who appears to fly in maginficient circles far above their heads.Perhaps, if 
we teachers were more honest about our own reading disabilities, less loath to reveal 
how hard it is for us to read and how often we fumble, we might get the students interest 
in the game of learning instead of the game of passing. 
 - 4 - 
I trust I have said enough to indicate to readers who cannot read that I am one who 
cannot read much better than they. My chief advantage is the clarity with which I know 
that I cannot, and perhaps why I cannot. That is the best fruit of years of experience in 
trying to teach others. Of course, if I am just a little better than someone else, I can help 
him somewhat. Although none of us can read well enough to satisfy ourselves, we may 
be able to read better than someone else. Although few of us read well for the most 
part, each of us may do a good job of reading in some particular connection, when the 
stakes are high enough to compel the rare exertion. 
The student who is generally superficial may, for a special reason, read some one thing 
well. Scholars who are as superficial as the rest of us in most of their reading often do a 
careful job when the text is in their own narrow field, especially if their reputations hang 
on what they say. On cases relevant to his practice, a lawyer is likely to read 
analytically. A physician may similarly read clinical reports which describe symptoms 
he is currently concerned with. But both these learned men may make similar effort in 
other fields or at other times. Even business assumes the air of a learned profession 
when its devotees are called upon to examine financial statements or contracts, though I 
have heard it said that many businessmen cannot read these documents intelligently 
even when their fortunes are at stake. 
If we consider men and women generally, and apart from their professions or 
occupations, there is only one situation I can think of in which they almost pull 
themselves up by their bootstraps, making an effort to read better than they usually do. 
When they are in love and are reading a love letter, they read between the lines and in 
the margins; they read the whole in terms of the parts, and each part in terms of the 
whole; they grow sensitive to context and ambiguity, to insinuation and implication; 
they perceive the color of words, the odor of phrases, and the weight of sentences.They 
may even take the punctuation into account. Then, if never before or after, they read. 
These examples, especially the last, are enough to suggest a first approximation of what 
I mean by "reading." That is not enough, however. What this is all about can be more 
accurately understood only if the different kinds and grades of reading are more 
definitely distinguished. To read this book intelligently！which is what this book aims 
to help its readers do with all books！such distinctions must be grasped. that belongs to 
the next chapter. Here suffice it if it is understood that this book is not about reading in 
every sense but only about that kind of reading which its readers do not do well enough, 
or at all, except when they are in love 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER TWO 
The Reading of "Reading" 
 - 1 - 
 One of the primary rules for reading anything is to spot the most important words the 
author uses. Spotting them is not enough, however. You have to know how they are 
being used. Finding an important word merely begins the more difficult research for the 
meanings, one or more, common or special, which the word is used to convey as it 
appears here and there in the text. 
You already know "reading" is one of the most important words in this book. But, as I 
have already sugggested, it is a word of many meanings. If you take for granted that you 
know what I mean by the word, we are likely to get into difficulties before we proceed 
much further. 
This business of using language to talk about language！specially if one is campaigning 
against its abuse！is risky. Recently Mr. Stuart Chase wrote a book which he should 
have called Words bout Words. He might then have avoided the barb of the critics who 
so quickly pointed out that Mr. Chase himself was subject to the tyranny of word. Mr. 
Chase recognized the peril when he said , "I shall frequently be caught in my own trap 
by using bad language in a plea for better." 
Can I avoid such pitfalls? I am writing about reading and so it would appear that I do 
not have to obey the rules of reading but of writing. My escape may be more apparrent 
than real, if it turns out that a writer should keep in mind the rules which govern 
reading. You, however, are reading about reading. You cannot escape. If the reules of 
reading I am going to suggest are sound, you must follow them in reading this book. 
But, you will say, how can we follow the rules until we learn and understand them? To 
do that we shall have to read some part of this book without knowing what the rules are. 
The only way I know to help out of this dilemma is by making you reading-conscious 
readers as we proceed. Let us start at once by applying the rule about find and 
interpreting the important words. 
 - 2 - 
When you start out to investigate the various senses of a word, it is usually wise to 
begin with a dictionary and your own knowledge of common usage. If you looked up 
"read" in the large Oxford Dictionary, you would find, first, that the same four letters 
constituted an obsolete noun referring to the fourth stomach of a ruminant, and the 
commonly used verb which refers to a mental activity involving words or symbols of 
some sort. You would know at once that we need not bother with the obsolete noun 
except, perhaps, to note that reading has something to do with rumination. You would 
discover next that the verb has twenty-one more or less closely related meanings, more 
or less common. 
One uncommon meaning of "to read" is to think or suppose. This meaning passes into 
the more usual one of conjecturing or predicting, as when we speak of reading the stars, 
one's prm, or one's future. That leads eventually to the meaning of the word in which it 
refers to perusing books or other written documents. There are many other meanings, 
such as verbal utterance ( when an actress reads her lines for the director); such as 
detecting what is not perceptible from what is (when we asy we can read a person's 

character in his face); such as instruction, academic or personal (when we have someone 
read us a lecture). 
The slight variations in usage seem endless; a singer reads music; a scientist reads 
nature; an engineer reads his instruments; a printer reads proof; we read between the 
lines; we read something into situation, or someone out of the party. 
We can simplify matters by noting what is common to many of these senses; namely, 
that mental activity is involved and that, in one way or another, symbols are being 
interpreted. That imposes a first limitation on our use of the word. We are not concerned 
with a part of the intestinal tract, nor are we concerned with enunciation, with speaking 
something out loud. A second limitation is need, because we shall not consider！except 
for some points of comparison！the interpretation, clairvoyant or otherwise, of natural 
signs such as stars hands, or faces. We shall limit ourselves to one kind of readable 
symbol, the kind which men invent for the purposes of communication！the words of 
human language. This eliminates the reading of other artificial signs such as the pointers 
on dials of physical apparatus, thermometers, gauges, speedometers, and so forth. 
Henceforth, then, you must read the word "reading," as it occurs in this text, to refer to 
the process of interpreting or understanding what presents itself to the senses in the form 
of words or other sensible marks. This is not arbitrary legislation about what the word 
"reading" means. It is simply a matter of defining our problem, which reading the in the 
sense of receiving communication. 
Unfortunately, that is not simple do do, as you would realize at once if someone asked: 
"What about listening? Isn't that receiving communication, too?" I shall subsquently 
discuss the relation of reading and listening, for the rules of good reading are for the 
most part the rules of good listening, though perhaps harder to apply in the latter case. 
Suffice it for the present to distinguish reading from listening by restricting the 
communication being received to what is written and printed rather than spoken. 
I shall try to use the word "reading" in the limited and special sense noted. But I know 
that I will not succeed without exception. It will be impossible to avoid using the word 
in some of its other senses. Sometimes I sha;; be thoughtful enough to mention 
explicitly that I am shifting the meaning. Other times I may suppose that the context is 
sufficient warning to you. Infrequently ( I hope ) I may shift the meaning without being 
aware of it myself. 
Be stout, gentle reader, for you are just beginning. What has gone before is just 
preliminary to finding out the even narrower sense in which the word "reading" will be 
used. We must now face the problem which the first chapter indicated. We must 
distinguish between the sense in which you can read this book, for instance, and are 
now doing so, and the sense in which you may learn from it to read better or diferently 
than you now can. 
Notice that I said "better" or "differently." The one word points to diffrence in degrees 
of ability, the other to a distinction in kinds. I suppose we shall find that the better 
reader can also do a different kind of reading. The poorer can probably do only one 
kind！the simplest kind. Let us first examine the range of ability in reading to 
determine what we mean by "better" and "poorer." 

- 3 - 
One obvious fact shows the existence of a wide range of degrees in ability to read. It is 
that reading begins in the primary grades and runs through every level of the 
educational system. Reading is the first of the three R's. It is first because we have to 
learn to read in order to learn by reading. Since what we have to learn, as we ascend in 
our education, becomes more difficult or complex, we must improve our ability to read 
proportionately. 
Literacy is everywhere the primary mark of education, but it has many degrees, from a 
grammar-school diploma, or even less, up to a bachelor's degree or a Ph.D. But, in his 
recent commentary on American democracy, called Of Human Fredom, Jacques Barzun 
cautions us not to be misled by the boast that we have the most literate population in the 
world. "Literacy in this sense is not education; it is not even 'knowing how to read' in 
the sense of taking in quickly and correctly the message of the printed page, to say 
nothing of exercising a critical judgement upon it." 
Supposedly, gradations in reading go along with graduations from one educational 
level to another. In the light of what we know about American education today, that 
supposition is not well founded. In France it is still true that the candidate for the 
doctor's degree must show an ability to read sufficient to admit him to that higher circle 
of literacy. What the French call explication de texte is an art which must be practiced at 
every educational level and in which improvement must be made before one moves up 
the scale. But in this country there is often little discenible difference between the 
explication which a high-school student would give and one by a college senior or even 
a doctoral candidate. When the task is to read a book, the high-school students and 
college freshmen are often better, if only because they are less thoroughly spoiled by 
bad habits. 
The fact that there ie something wrong with American education, so far as reading is 
concerned, means only that the gradations have become obscure for us, not that theydo 
not exist. Our task is to remove that obscurity. To make the distinction in grades of 
reading sharper, we must define the criteria of better and worse. 
What are the criteria? I think I have already suggested what they are, in the previous 
chapter. Thus, we say that one man is a better reader than another if he can read more 
difficult material. Anyone would agree, if Jones is able to read only such things as 
newspaper and magazines, whereas Brown can read the best current nonfiction books, 
such as Einstein and Infeld's Evolution of Physics or Hoben's Mathematics for the 
Millions, that Brown has more ability than Jones. Among readers at the Jones level, 
further discrimination may be made between those who cannot rise abouve the tabloids 
and those who can master The New York Times. Between the Jones and the Brown 
group, there are still others measured bythe better and worse magazines, better and 
worse current fiction, or by nonfiction books of a more popular nature than Einstein or 
Hogben, such as Gunther's Inside Europe or Heister's An American Doctor's Odyssey. 
And better and Brown is the man who can read Euclid and Descartes as well as Hogben, 
or Galileo and Newton as well as Einstein and Infeld's discussion of them. 
The first criterion is an obvious one. In many fields we measure a man's skill by the 
difficulty of the task he can perform. The accuracy of such measurement depends, of 
course, on the independent precision with which we can grade the tasks in difficulty. 
We could be moving in circles if we said, for instance, that the more difficult book is 
one which only the better reader can master. That is true, but not helpful. In order to 
understand what makes some books more difficult to read than others, we would have to 

know what demands they make on the skill of the reader. If we knew that, we would 
know what distinguishes better and worse readers. In other words, the difficulty of the 
reading ability, but it does not tell us what the difference is in the reader, so far as his 
skill is concerned. 
The first criterion has some use, nevertheless, to whatever extent it is true that the more 
difficult a book is the fewer readers it will have at any given time. There is some truth in 
this, because it generally the case that, as one mounts the scale of excellence in any 
skill, the number of practitioners diminishes: the higher, the fewer. Counting noses, 
therefore, gives us some independent indication of whether one thing is more difficult to 
read than another. We can construct a crude scale and measure men accordingly. In a 
sense, that is the way all the scales, which employ reading tests made by the educational 
psychologists, are constructed. 
The second criterion takes us further, but is harder to state. I have already suggested the 
distinction between active and passive reading. Strictly, all reading is active. What we 
call passive is simply less active. Reading is better or worse according as it is more or 
less active. And one reader is better than another in proportion as he is capable of a 
greater range of activity in reading. In order to explain this point, I must first be sure 
that you understand why I say that, strictly speaking, there is no absolutely passive 
reading. It only seems that way in contrast to more active reading. 
No one doubts that writing and speaking are active undertakings, in which the writer or 
speaker is clearly doing something. Many people seem to think, however, that reading 
and listening are entirely passive. Nowork need be done. they think of reading and 
listening as receiving communication from someone who is actively giving it. So far 
they are right, but then they make the error of supposing that receiving communication 
is like receiving a blow, or a legacy, or a judgement from the court. 
Let me use the example of baseball. Catching the ball is just as much an activity as 
pitching or hitting it. The pitcher or batter is the giver here in the sense that his activity 
initiates the motion of the ball. The catcher or fielder is the receiver in the sense that 
his activity terminates it. Both are equally active, though the activities are distinctly 
different. If anything is pasive here, it is the ball; it is pitched and caught. It is the inert 
thing which is written and read, like the ball, is the passive object common to the two 
activities which begin and terminate the process. 
We can go a step further with this analogy. A good catcher is one who stops the ball 
which has been hit or pitched. The art of catching is the skill of knowing how to do this 
as well as possible in every situation. So the art of reading is the skill of catching every 
sort of communication as well as possible. But the reader as "catcher" is more like the 
fielder than the man behind the plate. The catcher signals for a particular pitch. He 
knows what to expect. In a sense, the pitcher and catcher are like two men with but a 
single thought before the ball is thrown. Not so, however, in the case of the batter and 
fielder. Fielders may wish that batters would obey signals from them, but that isn't the 
way game is played. So readers may sometimes wish that wiriters would submit 
completely to their desires for reading matter, but the facts are usually otherwise. The 
reader has to go after what comes out into the field. 
The analogy breaks down at two points, both of which are instructive. In the first place, 
the batter and the fielder, being on opposite sides, do not have thesame end in view. 
Each thinks of himself as successful only if he frustrates the other. In contrast, pitcher 
and catcher are successful only to the extent that they co-operate. Here the realtion of 
writer and reader is more like that between the men on the battery. The writer certainly 

isn't trying not to be caught, although the reader may often think so. Succesful 
communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to have received finds 
its way into the reader's possession. The writer's and reader's skill converge upon a 
common end. 
In the second place, the ball is a simple unit. It is either a completely caught or not. A 
piece of writing, however, is a complex object. It can be received more or less 
completely, all the way from very little of what the writer intended to the whole thing. 
The amount the reader gets will usually depend on the amount of activity he puts into 
the process, as well as upon the skill with which he excutes the different mental acts that 
are involved. 
Now we can define the second criterion for judging reading ability. Given the same 
thing to read, one man reads it better than another, first, by reading it more actively, and 
second, by performing each of the acts involved more successfully. These two things 
are related. Reading is a complex activity, just as writing is. It consists of a large 
number of separate acts, all of which must be performed in a good reading. Hence, the 
man who can perform more of these various acts is better able to read. 
 - 4 - 
I have not reallytold you what good and bad reading are. I have talked about the 
differences only in a vague and generala way. Nothing else is possible here. Untill you 
know the rules which a good reader must follow, you will not be able to understand 
what is involved. 
I know of no short cut by which you can be shown now, clearly and in detail, what I 
hope you will see before you have finished. You may not see it even then. reading a 
book on how to play tennis may not sufficient to make you perceive from the side lines 
the various shades of skill in playing. If you stay on the side lines, you will never know 
how it feels to play better or worse. Similarly, you have to put the rules of reading into 
practice before you are really able to understand them and competent to judge your own 
accomplishment or that of others. 
But I can do one thing more here which may help you get the feel of what reading is. I 
can distinguish different types of reading for you. 
I dicovered this way of talking about reading under the dire necessity which a lecture 
platform sometimes imposes. I was lecturing about education to three thousand school-
teachers. I had reached the point where I was bemoaning the fact that college students 
couldn't read and that nothing was being done about it. I cluld see from their faces that 
they didn't know what I was talking about. Weren't they teaching the children how to 
read? In fact, that was being done in the very lowest grades. Why should I be asking 
that four years of college be spent primarily in learning to read and in reading great 
books? 
Under the provocation of their general incredulity, and their growing impatience with 
my nonsense, I went further. I said that most people could not read, that many university 
professors I knew could not, that probably my autidnce cound not read either. The 
exaggeration only made matters worse. They knew they cound read. They did it every 
day. What in the world was this idiot on the platform raving about? Then it was that I 
figured out how to explain. I doing so, I distinguished two kinds of reading. 

The explanation went something like this. Here is a book, I said, and here is your mind. 
The book consists of language written by someone for the sake of communicating 
something to you. Your success in reading is determined by the extent to which you get 
all that writer intended to communicate. 
Now, as you go through the pages, either you understand perfectly everything the author 
has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained information, but you could not 
have increased your understanding. If, upon effortless inspection, a book is completely 
intelligble to you, then the author and you are as two minds in the same mold. The 
symbols on the page merely express the common understanding you had before you 
met. 
Let us take the second alternative. You do not understand the book perfectly at once. 
Let us even assume！what unhappily is not always true！that you understand enough to 
know that you do not understand it all. You know there is more in the book than you 
understand and, hence, that the book contains something which can increase your 
understanding. 
What do you do then? You can do a number os things. You can take the book to 
someone else who, you think, can read better than you, and have him to explain the 
parts that troubled you. Or you can get him to recommend a textbook or commentary 
which will make it all plain by telling you what the author meant. Or you may decide, as 
many students do, that what's over your head isn't worth bothering about, that you 
understand enough, and the rest doesn't matter. If you do any of these things, you are 
not doing the job of reading which the book requires. 
That is done in one way only. Without external help, you take the book into your study 
and work on it. With nothing but the power of your mind, you operate on the symbols 
before you in such a way that you gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding 
less to one understanding more. Such elevation, accomplished by the mind working on a 
book, is reading, the kind of reading that a book which challenges your understanding 
deserves. 
Thus I roughly defined what I meant by reading: the process whereby a mind, with 
nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from 
outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from 
understanding less to understanding more. The operations which cause this to happen 
are the various acts which constitute the art of reading. "How many of these acts do you 
know?" I asked the three thousand teachers. "What things would you do by yourself if 
your life depended on understanding something readable which at first persual left you 
somewhat in the dark?" 
Now their faces frankly told a different story. They plainly confessed that they wouldn't 
know what to do. They signified, moreover, that they would be willing to admit there 
was such an art and that some people must possess it. 
Clearly not all reading is of the sort I have just described. We do a great deal of reading 
by which we are in no way elevated, though we may be informed, amused, or irritated. 
There would appear to be several types of reding: for information, for entertainment, for 
understanding. This sounds at first as if it were only a difference in the purpose with 
which we read. That is only partly so. In part, also, it depends on a difference in the 
thing to be read and the way of reading. You cannot gain much information from the 
funny sheet or much intellectual elevation from an almanac. As the things to be read 
have different values, we must use tham accordingly. We must satisfy each of our 

different purposes by going to the sort of material for each. More than that, we must 
know how to satisfy our purposes by being able to read each sort of material 
appropriately. 
Omitting, for the present,, reading for amusement, I wish to examine here the other two 
main types: reading for information and reading to understand more. I think you will see 
the relation between these two types of reading and the degrees of reading ability. The 
poorer reader is usually able todo only the first sort of reading: for information. The 
better reader can do that , of cousre, and more. He can increase his understanding as 
well as his store of facts. 
To pass from understanding less to ounderstanding more, by your own intellectual effort 
in reading, is something like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I certainly feels that 
way. It is a major exertion. Obvilusly, it would be a more active kind of reading, 
entailing not only more varied activity but more skill in the performance of thevarious 
acts required. Obviously, too, the things which are usually regarded as more difficult to 
read, and hence only for the better reader, are those which are most likely to deserve and 
demand this type of reading. 
Things you can comprehend without effort, such as magazines and newspapers, require 
a minimim of reading. You need very little art. You can read in a relatively passive way. 
For everyone who can read at all, there is some material of this sort, though it may be 
different for different individuals. What for one man requires no or little effort may 
demand genuine exertion from another. How far any man may get by expending every 
effort will depend on how much skill he has or is able to acquire, and that is somehow 
relative to his native intelligence. 
The point, however, is not to distinguish good and bad readers accoring to the favors or 
deprivations of birth. The point is that for each individual there exists two sorts of 
readable matter: one the one hand, something which he can read effortlessly to be 
informed, because it communicates nothing which he cannot immediately comprehend; 
on the other, something which is above him, in the sense of challenging to to make the 
effort t understand. It may, of course, be too far above him, forever beyond his grasp. 
But this he cannot tell until he tries, and he cannot try untill he develops the art of 
reading！the skill to make the effort. 
 - 5 - 
Most of us do not know what the limits of our comprehension are. We have never tried 
our powers to the full. It is my honest belief that almost all of the great books in every 
field are within the grasp of all normally intelligent men, on the condition, of course, 
that they acquire the skill, necessary for reading them and make the effort. Of course, 
those more favored by birth will reach the goal more readily, but the race is not always 
to the swift. 
There are severalminor points here which you must observe. It is possible to be 
mistaken in your jedgement of something your reading. You may thing you understand 
it, and be content with what you get fron an effortless reading, whereas in fact much 
may have escaped you. The first maxim of sound practice is an old one: the beginning 
of widson is a just appraisal of one's ignorance. So the beginning of reading as a 
conscious effort to understand is an accurate perception of the line between what is 
intelligible and what is not. 

I have seen many students read a difficult book just as if they were reading the sports 
page. Sometines I would ask at the beginning of a class if they had any questions about 
the text, if there was anything they did not understand. Their silence answered in the 
negative. At the end of two hours, during which they could not answer the simplest 
questions leading to an interpretation of the book, they would admit their deficiency in a 
puzzled way. They were puzzled because they were quite honest in their belief that they 
had read the text. They had, indeed, but not in the right way. 
If they had allowed themselves to be puzzled while reading, instead of after the class 
was over; if they had encouraged themselves to note the things they did not understand, 
instead of putting such matters immediately out of mind, they might have discovered 
that the book in fornt of them was different from their usual diet. 
Let me summarize now the distinction between these two types of reading. We shall 
have to consider both because the line between what is readable in one way and what 
must be read in the other is often hazy. To whatever extent we can keep the two kinds of 
reading distinct, we can use the word "reading" in two distinct senses. 
The first sense is the one in which we speak of ourselves as reading newspapers, 
magazines, or anything else which, according to our skill and talents, is at once 
thoroughly intelligible to us. Such things may increase the store of information we 
remember, but they cannot improve our understanding, for our understanding was equal 
to them before we started. Otherwise, we would have felt the shock of puzzlement and 
perplexity which comes form getting in over our depth！that is, if we were both alert 
and honest. 
The second sense is the one in which I would say a man has to read something that at 
first he does not completely understand. Here the thing to be read is initially better than 
the reader. The writer is communicating something which can increase the reader's 
understanding. Such communication between unequals must be possible , or else one 
man could never learn from another, either through speech of writing. Here by 
"learning" I mean understanding more, not remembering more informatiion which has 
the same degree intelligibility as other information you already possess. 
There is clearly no difficulty about getting new information in the course of reading if, 
as I say, the novel facts are of the same sort as those you already know, so far as their 
intelligibility goes. Thus, a man who knows some of the facts of American history and 
understands them in a certain light can readily acquire by reding , in the first sense, 
more such facts and understand them in the same light. But suppoes he is reading a 
history which seeks not merely to give some more facts but to throw a new and, 
perhaps, more profound light on all the facts he knows. Suppose there is greater 
understanding here than he possesses before he starts to read. If he can mamage to 
acquire that greater understanding, he is reading in the second sense. He has literally 
elevated himself by his own activity, though indirectly, of couurse, this was made 
possible by the writer who had something to teach him. 
What are the conditions under which this kind of reading takes place? There are two. In 
the first place, there is initial inequality in understanding. The writer must be superior to 
the reader, and his book must convey in readable form the insights he possesses and his 
potential readers lack. In the second place, the reader must be able to overcome this 
inequality in some degree, seldom perhaps fully, but always approaching equality with 
the writer. To the extent that equality is approached, the communication is perfectly 
consummated. 

In short, we can learn only from our betters. We must know who they are and how to 
learn from them. The man who has this sort ofknowledge possesses the art of reading in 
the sense with which I am specially concerned. Every one probably has some ability to 
read in this way. But all of us gain more by our efforts through applying them to more 
rewarding materials. 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
Reading is Learning 
 - 1 - 
ONE rule of reading, as you have seen, is to pick out and interpret the important words 
in a book. There is another and closely related rule: to discover the important sentences 
and to understand what they mean. 
The words "reading is learning" make a sentence. That sentence is obviously important 
for this discussion. Infact, I would say that it is the most important sentence so far. Its 
importance is indicated by the weightiness of the words which compose it. They are not 
important words but also ambiguous ones, as we have seen in the case of "reading." 
Now, if the word "reading" has meanings, and similarly the word "learning," and if that 
little word "is" takes the prize for ambiguity, you are in no position to affirm or deny the 
sentence. It means a number of things, some of which may be true and some false. 
When you have found out the meaning of each of the three words, as I have used them, 
you will have discovered the proposition I am trying to convey. Then, and only then, 
can you decide whether you agree with me. 
Since you know that we are not going to consider reading for amusement, you might 
charge me with inaccuracy for not having said: "Some reading is learning." My defense 
is on which you as a reader will soon come to anticipate. The context made it 
unnecessary for me to say "some." It was understood that we we going to ignore reading 
for amusement. 
To interpret the sentence, we must first ask: What os learning? Obviously, we cannot 
discuss learning adequately here. The only brief way out is to make a rough a 
approximation in terms of what everybody knows: that learning is acquiring knowledge. 
Don't run away. I am not going to define "knowledge." If I tried to do that, we would be 
swamped by the number of other words which would suddenly become inportant and 
demamd explication. For our purposes your present understanding of "knowledge" is 
sufficient. You have knowledge. You know that you know and what you know. You 
know the diffenence between knowing and not knowing something. 
If you were called upon to give a philosophical account of the nature of knowledge, you 
might be stumped; but so have many philosophers been. Let us leave them to their 
worries, and proceed to ue the word "knowledge" on the assumptiion that we understand 
each other. But, you may onject, even if we assume that we have a sufficient grasp of 
what we mean by "knowledge,"there are other difficulties in saying that learning is 
acquiring knowledge. One learns how to play tennis or cook. Playing tennis and 
cooking are now knowledge. They are ways of doing something which require skill. 

The objection has point. Although knowledge is involved in every skill, having a skill is 
having something more than knowledge. The person who has skill not only knows 
something but can do something which the person lacking it cannot do at all or as well. 
There is a familiar distinction here, which all of us make when we speak of knowing 
how(to do something) as opposed to knowing that (something is the case). One can 
learn how as well as that. You have already acknowledged this distinction in 
recognizing that one has to learn how to read in order to learn from reading. 
An initial restriction is thus imposed on the word "learning" as we are using it. Reading 
is learning only in the sense of gaining knowledge and not the skill. You cannot learn 
how to read just by reading this book. All you can learn is the nature of reading and the 
rules of the art. That may help you learn how to read, but it is not sufficient. I addition, 
you must follow the rules and practice the art. Only in that way can the skill be required, 
which is something over and above the knowledge that a mere book can communicate. 
 - 2 - 
So far, so good. But now we must turn to the distinctioin between reading for 
information and reading ro understanding. In the preceding chapter, I suggested how 
much more active the ltter sort of reading must be, and how it feels to do it. Now we 
must consider the difference in what you get out of these two kinds of reading. Both 
information and understanding are knowledge in some sense. Getting more information 
is learning, and so is coming to understanding what you did not understand before. 
What is the difference? 
To be informed is to know simply that something is the case. To be enlightened is to 
know, in addition, what it is all about: why it is the case, what its connections are with 
other facts, in what respects it is the same and different, and so forth. 
Most of us are acquainted with this distinction in terms of the difference between being 
able to remember something and being able to explain it. If you remember what an 
author says, you have learned something from reading him. If what he says is true, you 
have even learned something about the world. But whether it is a fact about the book or 
the world, you have gained nothing but information if you have exercised only your 
memory. Yo have not been enlightened. That happens only when, in addition to 
knowing what an author says, you know what he means and why he says it. 
A single example may help us here. What I am going to report happened in a class in 
which we were reading Thomas Aqhinas's treatise on the passions, but the same thing 
has happened in countless other classes with many different sorts of material. I asked a 
student what St. Thomas had to say about the order of the passions. H e quite correctly 
told me that love, according to St. Thomas, is the first of all the passions and that the 
other emotions, which he named accurately, follow in a certain order. Then I asked him 
what it meant to say this. He looked startled. Had he not answered my question 
correctly? I told him he had, but repeated my request for an explanation. He had told me 
what St. Thomas said. Now I wanted to know what St. Thomas meant. The student 
tried, but all he could do was to repeat, in slightly altered order, the same words he had 
used to answer my original question. It soon became obvious that he did not know what 
he was talking about, even though he would have made a good score on any 
examination which went no further than my original questions or questions of a similar 
sort. 
I tried to help him. I asked him whether love was first in the sense of being a cause of 
other emotions. I asked him how hate and anger, hope and fear, depended on love. I 

asked him about the relations of joy and grief to love. And what is love? Is love hunger 
for food and thirst for drink, or is it only what wonderful feeling which is supposed to 
make the world go round? Is the desire for money of fame, knowledge or happiness, 
love? In so far as he could answer these questions by repeating more or less accurately 
the words of St. Thomas, he did. When he made errors in reporting, other members of 
the class could make any headway with explaining what it was all about. 
I still tried another tack. I asked them, begging their pardon, about their own emotional 
experience. They were all old enough to have had a few passions. Did they ever hate 
anybody, and did it have anything to do with loving that person or somebody else? Had 
they ever experience a sequence of emotions, one of which somehow led into another? 
They were very vague, not because they were embarassed or because they had never 
been emotionally upset but because they totally unaccustomed to thinking about their 
experience in this way. Clearly they had not made any connection between the words 
they had read in a book about the passions and their own experiences. These things were 
as in worlds apart. 
It was becoming apparent why they did not have the faintest understanding of what they 
had read. It was just words they had memorized to be able to repeat somehow when I 
shot an question at them. That was what they did in other courses. I was asking too 
much of them. 
I still persisted. Perhaps, if they could not understand Aquinas in the light of their own 
experience, they might be able to use the vicarious experience they got from reading 
novels. They had read some fiction. Here and there some of them had even a great 
novel. Did passions occur in these stories? Were there different passions and how were 
they related? They did as badly here as before. They answered by telling me the story in 
a superficial summary of the plot. They understood the novels they had read about as 
little as they understood St. Thomas. 
Finally, I asked whether they had ever taken any other courses in which passions or 
emotions had been discussed. Most of them had had an elementary course in 
psychology, and one or two of them had even heard of Freud, and perhaps read a little 
of him. When I discovered that they had made no connection whatsoever between the 
physiology of emotion, in which they had probably passed creditable examinations, and 
the passions as St. Thomas discussed them; when I found out they could not even see 
that St. Thomas was making the same basic point as Freud, I realized what I was up 
against. 
These students were college juniors and seniors. They could read in one sense but not 
in another. All their years in school they had been reading for information only, the sort 
of information you have to get from something assigned in order to answer quizzes and 
examinations. They never connected one book with another, one course with another, or 
anything that was said in books or lectures with what happened to them in their own 
lives. 
Not knowing that there was something more to do with a book than commit its more 
obvious statements to memory, they were totally innocent of their dismal failure when 
they came to class. According to their lights, they had conscientiously prepared the 
day's lesson. It had never occured to them they might be called upon to show that they 
understood what they had read. Even when a number of such class sessions began to 
make them aware of this novel requirement, they were helpless. At best they became a 
little more aware that they did not understand what they were reading , but they could 

do little about it. Here, near the end of their schooling, they were totally unskilled in the 
art of reading to understand. 
 - 3 - 
When we read for information, we require facts.When we read to understand, we learn 
not only facts but their significance. Each kind of reading has its virtue, but it must be 
used in the right place. If a writer does not understand more than we do, or if in 
particular passage he makes no effort to explain, we can only informed by him, not 
enlightened. But if an author has insights we do not possess and if, in addition, he has 
tried to convey them in what he has written, we are neglecting his gift to us if we do not 
read him differently from the way in which we read newspapers or magazines. 
The books we acknowledge to be great or good are usually those which deserve the 
better sort of reading. It is true, of course, that anything can be read for informational as 
well as understanding. One should be able to remember what the author said as well ass 
know what he meant. In a sense, being informed is prerequisite to being enlightened. 
The point, however, is not to stop at being informed. It is as wasteful to read a great 
book solely for information as to use a fountain pen for digging worms. 
Montaigne speaks of "an abecedarian ignorance that precedes knowledge, and a 
doctoral ignorance that comes after it." The one is the ignorance of those who, not 
knowing their ABC's, cannot read at all. The other is the ignorance of those who have 
misread many books. They are, as Pope rightly calls them, bookful of blockheads, 
ignorantly read. There have always been literate ignoramuses who have read too widely 
and not well. The Greeks had a name for such mixture of learning and folly, which 
might be applied to the bookish but poorly read of all ages. They are all sophomores. 
Being well read too often means the quantity, too seldom the quality, of reading. It was 
not only the pessimistic and misanthropic Schopenhauer who inveighed against too 
much reading, because the found that, for the most part, men read passively and glutted 
themselves with toxic overdoses of unassimilated information. Bacon and Hobbes made 
the same point. Hobbes said: "If I read as many books as most men"！he meant 
"misread"！"I should be as dull-witted as they." Bacon distinguished between "books to 
be tasted, others to be swalled, and some few to be digested." The point that remains the 
same throughout rest on the distinction between different kinds of reading appropriate to 
different kinds of literature. 
 - 4 - 
We have made some progress in interpreting the sentence "reading is learning." We 
know that some, but not all, learning can be achieved through reading: the acquisition of 
knowledge but not of skill. If we concluded, however, that the kind of reading which 
results in increased information or understanding is identical with the kind of learning 
which results in more knowledge, we would be making a serious error. We would be 
saying that no one can acquire knowledge except through reading, which is clearly 
false. 
To avoid this error, we must now consider one further distinction in types of learning. 
This distinction has a significant bearing on the whole business of reading, and its 
relation to education generally. (If the point I am now going to make is unfamiliar to 
you, and perhaps somewhat difficult, I sugget that you take the following pages as a 
challenge to your skill in reading. This is a good place to begin active reading！marking 

the important words, noting the distinctions, seeing how the meaning of the sentence 
with which we started expands. 
In the history of education, men have always distinguished between instruction and 
discovery as sources of knowledge. Instruction occurs when one man teachers another 
through speech or writing. We can, however, gain knowledge without being taught. If 
this were not the case, and every teacher had to be taught what he inturn teaches others, 
there would be no beginning in the acquisition of knowledge. Hence, there must be 
discovery！the process of learning something by research, by investigation, or by 
reflection, without being taught. 
Discovery stands to instruction as learning without a teacher to learning through the 
help of one. In both cases, the activity of learning goes on the one who learns. It would 
be a great mistake to suppose that discovery is active learning and instruction passive. 
There is no passive leraning, as there is no complete passive reading. 
The difference between the two activities of learning is with respect to the materials on 
which the learner works. When he is being taught or instructed, the learner acts on 
something communicated to him. He performs operations on discourse, written or oral. 
He learns by acts of reading or listening. Note here the close relation between reading 
and listening. If we ignore the mimor differences between these two ways of receiving 
communication, we can say that reading and listening are the same art！the art of being 
taught. When, however, the learner proceeds without the help of any sort of teacher, the 
operations of learning are performed on nature rather than discourse. The rules of such 
learning constitute the art of discovery. If we use the word "reading" loosely, we can 
say that discovery is the art of reading nature, as instruction (being taught) is the art of 
reading books or, to include listening, of learning from discourse. 
What about thinking? If by "thinking" we mean the use of our minds to gain knowledge, 
and if instruction and discovery exhaust the ways of gaining knowledge, then clearly all 
our thinking must take place during one or the other of these two activities. We must 
think during the course of reading and listening, just as we must think in the course of 
research. Naturally, the kinds of thinking are different！as different as the two ways of 
learning are. 
The reason why many people regard thinking as more closely associated with research 
and discovery than with being taught is that they suppose reading and listening to be 
passive affairs. It is probably true that one does less thinking when one reads for 
information than when one is undertaking to discover something. That is the less active 
sort of reading. But it is not true of the more active reading！the effort to understand. 
No one who has done this sort of reading would say it can be done thoughtlessly. 
Thinking is only one part of the activity of learning. One must also use one's senses and 
imagination. One must observe, and remember, and construct imaginatively what 
cannot be observed. There is, again, a tendency to stress the role of these activities in 
the process of research or discovery and to forget or minize their place in the process of 
being taught through reading or listening. A moment's reflection will show that the 
sensitive as well as the rational powers, in short, includes all the same skills that are 
involved in the art of discovery: kenness of observation, readily available memory, 
range of imagination, and, of course, a reason trained in anaysis and reflection. Though 
in general the skills are the same, they may be differently employed in the two major 
types of learning. 

- 5 - 
I would like to stress again the two errors which are so frequently made. One is made by 
those who write or talk about an art of thinking as if there were any such thing in and by 
itself. Since we never think apart from the work of being taught or the process of 
research, there is no art of thinking apart from the art of reading and listening, on the 
one hand, the art of discovery, on the other. To whatever extent it is true that reading is 
learning, it is also trye that reading is thinking. A complete account of the art of thinking 
can be given only in the context of a complete analysis of reading and research. 
The other error is made by those who write about the art of thinking as if it were 
identical with art of discovery. The outstanding example of this error, and one which 
has tremendously influenced American education, is John Dewey's How We Think. This 
book has been the bible for thousands of teachers who have been trained in our schools 
of education. Professor Dewey limits his discussion of thinking to its occurrence in 
learning by discovery. But that is only one of the two main ways we think. It is equally 
important to know how we think when we read a book or listen to a lecture. Perhaps, it 
is even more important for teachers who are engaged in instruction, since the art of 
reading must be related to the art of being taught, as the art of writing is related to the 
art of reading. I doubt whether anyone who does not know how to read well can write 
well. I similarly doubt whether anyone who does not have the art of being taught is 
skilled in teaching. 
The cause of these errors is probably complex. Partly, they may be due to the false 
supposition that teaching and research are activities, whereas reading and being taught 
are merely passive. In part also, these errors are due to an exaggeration of the scientific 
method, which stresses investigation or research as if it were the only occasion for 
thought. There probably was a time when the opposite error was made: when men 
overemphasized the reading of books and paid too little attention to the reading of 
nature. That does not exucse us, however. Either extreme is equally bad. A balanced 
education must place a just emphasis on both types of learning and on the arts they 
require. 
Whatever their causes, the efffect of these errors on American education is only too 
obovious. They may account for the almost total neglect of intelligent reading 
throughout the school system. Much more time is spent in training students how to 
discover things for themselves than in training them how to learn from others. There is 
no particular virtue, it seems to me, in wasting time to fine out for yourself what has 
already been discovered. One should save one's skill in research for what has not yet 
been discovered, and exercise one's skill in being taught for learning what others 
already know and therefore can teach. 
A tremendous amount of time is wasted in laboratory courses in this way. The usual 
apology for the excess of laboratory ritual is that it trains the student how to think. True 
enough, it does, but only in one type of thinking. A roundly educated man, even a 
research scientist, should also be able to think while reading. Each generation of men 
should not have to learn everything for themselves, as nothing had ever learned before. 
In fact, they cannot. 
Unless the art of reading is cultivated, as it is not in American education today, the use 
of books must steadily diminish. We may continue to gain some knowledge by speaking 
to nature, for it will always answer, but there is no point in our ancestors speaking to us 
unless we know how to listen. 

You may say there is little difference between reading books and reading nature. But 
remember that the things of nature are not symbols communicating something from 
other human mind, whereas the words we read and listen to are. And remember also that 
when we seek to learn from nature directly, our ultimate aim is to understand the world 
in which we live. We neither agree nor disagree with nature, as we often do the the case 
of books. 
Our ultimate aim is the same when we seek to learn from books. But, in this second 
case, we must first be sure we understand what the book is saying. Olny then can we 
decide whether we agree or disagree with its author. The process of understanding 
nature directly is different from that of coming to understand it through interpreting a 
book. The critical faculty need be employed only in the latter case. 
 - 6 - 
I have been proceeding as if reading and listening could both be treated as learning from 
teachers. To some extent that is true. Both are ways of being instructed, and for both 
one must be skilled in the art of being taught. Listening to a course of lectures is in 
many respects like reading a book. Many of the rules I shall formulate for the reading of 
books apply to taking lecture courses. Yet there is good reason for placing our 
discussion to the art of reading, or at least placing our primary emphasis on reading, and 
letting the other applications become a secondary concern. The reason is that listening is 
learning fron a living teacher, while reading is learning from a dead one, or at least one 
who is not present to us except through his writing. 
If you ask a living teacher a question, he may really answer you. If you are puzzled by 
what he says, you may save yourself the trouble of thinking by asking him what he 
means. If, however, you ask a book a question, you must answer it yourself. In this 
respect a book is like nature. When you speak to it, it answers you only to the extent that 
you do the work of thinking and analysis yourself. 
I do not mean, of course, that if the teacher answers your question, you have no further 
work. That is so only if the question is simply one of the fact. But if you are seeking an 
explanation, you have to understand it or nothing has been explained to you. 
Nevertheless, with the living teacher available to you, you are given a lift in the 
direction of understanding him, as you are not when the teacher's words in a book are 
all you have to go by. 
But books can also be read under the guidance and with the help of teachers. So we 
must consider the relation between books and teachers！between being taught by books 
with and without the aid of teachers. That is a matter for the next chapter. Obviously, it 
is a matter which concerns those of us who are still in school. But it also concerns those 
of us who are not, for we may have to depend on books alone as the means for 
continuing our education, and we ought to know how to make books teach us well. 
Perhaps we are better off for lacking teachers, perhaps worse. 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER FOUR 
Teachers, Dead or Alive 
 - 1 - 
We can be instructed by listening to a lecture as well as through reading a book. That is 
what brings us to the consideration now of books and teachers, to complete our 
understanding of reading as learning. 
Teaching, as we have seen, is the process whereby one man learns from another through 
communication. Instruction is thus distinguished from discovery, which is the process 
whereby a man learns something by himself, through observing and thinking about the 
world, and not by receiving communicatioin from other men. It is true, of course, that 
these two kinds of learning are intimately and intricately fused in the actual education of 
any man. Each may help the other. But the point remains that we can always tell, if we 
take the pains to do so, whether we learned something we know from someone else or 
whether we found it out for ourselves. 
We may even be able to tell whether we have learned it from a book or from a teacher. 
But, by the meaning of the word "teaching," the book which taught us something can be 
called a "teacher." We must distinguish, therefore, between writing teachers and 
speaking teachers, teachers we learn from by reading and teachers we learn from by 
listening. 
For convenience of reference, I shall call the speaking teacher a "live teacher." He is a 
human being with whom we have some personal contact. And I shall call books "dead 
teachers." Please note that I do not mean to say that the author of the book is dead. In 
fact, he may be the very alive teacher who not only lectures at us but makes read a 
textbook he has written. 
Whether or not the author is dead, the book is a dead thing. I cannot talk back to us, or 
answer questions. It does not grow and change its mind. It is a communication, but we 
cannot converse with it, in the sense in which we may succeed, once in a while, in 
communicating something to our living teachers. The rare cases in which we have been 
able to converse profitably with the author of a book we have read may make us realize 
our deprivation when the author is dead or at least unavailble for conversation. 
 - 2 - 
What is the role of the live teacher in our education? A live teacher may help us to 
acquire certain skills: may teach us how to cut pin wheels in kindergarten, how to form 
and recognize letters in the early grades, or how to spell and pronounce, how to do sums 
and long division, how to cook, sew, and do carpentry. A live teacher may assist us to 
develop any art, even the arts of learning itself, such s the art of experimental research 
or the art of reading. 
In giving such aid, more than communication is usually involved. The live teacher not 
only tells us what to do, but is particulalry useful in showing us how and, even more 
directly, in helping us to go through the motions. On these latter counts, there is no 
question that a live teacher can be more helpful than a dead one. The most successful 
how-to-book cannot take you by the hand or say at the right moment, "stop doing it that 
way. Do it this way." 

Now, one thing is immediately clear. With respect to all the knowledge we gain by 
discovery, a live teacher can perform only on function. He obviously cannot teach us 
that knowledge, for then we could not gain it by discovery. He can only teach us the art 
of discovery, that is, tell us how to do research, how to observe and think in the process 
of finding things out. He may, in addition, help us to become expert in the motions. In 
general this is the province of a book like Dewey's How We Think and of those who 
have tried to help students practice according to its rules. 
Since we are primarily concerned with reading！and with the other kind of learning, 
through instruction！we can limit our discussion to the role of the teacher as one who 
communicates knowledge or help us to learn from communication. And, for the time 
being, let us even limit ourselves to considering the live teacher as a source of 
knowledge, and not as a preceptor who help us learn how to do something. 
Considered as a source of knowledge, the live teacher either competes with or co-
operate with dead teachers, that is, with books. By competition I mean the way in which 
many live teachers tell their students by lectures what the students could learn by 
reading the books the lecturer himself digested. Long before the magazine existed, live 
teachers earned their living by being "readers' digests." By co-operation I mean the way 
in which the live teacher somehow divides the function of teaching between himself and 
available books: some things he tells the student, usually boiling down what he himself 
has read, and some things he expects the student to learn by reading. 
If these were the only functions a live teacher performed with respect to the 
communication of knowledge, it would follow that anything which can be learned in 
school can be learned outsied of school and without live teachers. It might take a little 
more trouble to read for yourself than to have books digested for you. You might have 
to read more books, if books were your only teachers. But to whatever extent, it is true 
that the live teacher has no knowledge to communicate except what he himself learned 
by reading, you can learn it directly from books yourself. You can learn it as well if you 
can read as well. 
I suspect, moreover, that if what you seek is understanding rather information, reading 
will take you further. Most of us are guilty of the vice of passive reading, of course; but 
most of people are even more likely to be passive in listening to a lecture. A lecture has 
been well described as the process whereby the notes of the teacher become the notes of 
the student without passing through the mind of either. 
Note taking is usually not an active assimilation of what is to be understood, but an 
almost automatic record of what was said. The habit of doing it becomes a more 
pervasive substitute for learning and thinking as one spends more years in educational 
institutions. It is worst in the professional schools, such as law and medicine, and the 
graduate school. Someone said you can tell the difference between graduate and 
undergraduate students in this way. If you walk into a classrom and say "Good 
Morning," and the students reply, they are undergraduates. If they write it down, they 
are graduate students. 
There are two other functions a live teacher performs, by which he related to books. 
One is repetition. We have all taken courses in school in which the teacher said in class 
the very same things we were assigned to read in a textbook written by him or one of his 
colleagues. I have been guilty of teaching that way myself. I remember the first course I 
ever taught. It was elementary psychology. A textbook was assigned. The examination 
which the department set for all the sections of this course indicate that the student need 
only learn what the textbook said. My only function as a living teacher was to help the 

textbook do its work. In part, I asked questions of the sort that might be asked on an 
examination. In part, I lectured, repeating the book chapter by chapter, in words not 
very different from those the author used. 
Occasionally I may have tried to explain a point, but if the student had done a job of 
reading for understanding, he could have understood the point by himself. If he could 
not read that way, he probably could not listen to my explanation in an understanding 
way either. 
Most of the students were taking the course for credit, not merit. Since the examination 
did not measure understanding but information, they probably regarded my explanations 
as a waste of their time！sheer exhibitionism on my part. Why they continued to come 
to class, I do not know. If they had spent as much time reading the textbook as the sport 
page, and with the same diligence for details of information, they could have passed the 
examination without being bored by me. 
 - 3 - 
The function which remains to be discussed is difficult to name. Perhaps I can call it 
"original communication." I am thinking of the living instructor who knows something 
which cannot be found in books anywhere. It must be something which he has himself 
discovered and has not yet made available for readers. This happens rarely. It happens 
today most frequently in the fields of scholarship or scientific research. Every now and 
then the graduate school is graded by a course of lectures which constitute an original 
communication. If you are not fortunate enough to hear the lectures, you usually 
console yourself by saying that they will probably appear in book form shortly. 
The printing of books has now become such routine and common affair that it is not 
likely any more that original communications must be heard or lost. Before Caxton, 
however, the living teacher probably performed this function more frequently. That was 
why students traveled all over medieval Europe to hear a famous lecturer. If one goes 
back far enough in the history of European lerning, one comes to the early time before 
knowledge had been funded, before there was a tradition of learning whoch one 
generation received from its predecessor and passed on the next. Then, of course, the 
teacher was primarily a man of knowledge and communicator secondarily. I mean he 
had first to get knowledge by discovering it himself, before he could teach it to anyone 
else. 
The present day situation is at the other extreme. The living teacher today is primarily a 
man of learning, rather than a discoverer. He is one who has learned most of what he 
knows from other teachers, alive or dead. Let us consider the average teacher today as 
one who no original communication to make. In relation to dead teachers, therefore, he 
must be either a repeater or digester. In either case, his students could learn everything 
he knows by reading the books he has read. 
With respect to the communication of knowledge, the only justification for the living 
teacher, then, is a practical one. The flesh being weak, it takes the easier course. The 
paraphernalia of lectures, assignments, and examinations maybe a surer and more 
efficient way of getting a certain amount of information, and even a little understanding, 
into the rising generatioins's heads. Even if we had trained them how to read well, we 
might not be able to trust them to keep at the hard work of reading in order to learn. 
The self-educated man is as rare as the self-made man. Most men do not become 
genuinely learned or amass large fortunes through their own efforts. The existence of 

such men, however, shows it can be done. theirrarity indicates the exceptional qualities 
of character！the stamina and self-discipline, the patience and perseverance！which are 
required. In knowledge as in wealth, most of us have to be spoon-fed to the little we 
possess. 
These facts, and their practical consequences for institutional education, do not alter the 
main point, however. What is true of the average teacher is equally true of all textbooks, 
manuals, and syllabi. These, too, are nothing but repetitions, compiliations, and 
condensations of what can be found in other books, often other books of the same sort. 
There is one exception, however, and that makes the point. Let us call those living 
teachers who perform the function of original communication the primary teachers. 
There are few in every generation, though most are primary and secondary teachers who 
are alive now, so among dead teachers we can make the same distinction. There are 
primary and secondary books. 
The primary books are those which contain original communications. They need not be 
original in entirety, of course. On the contraray, complete originality is both iinpossible 
and misleading. It is impossible except at the hypothetical beginning of our cultural 
tradition. It is misleading because no one should try to discover for himself what he can 
be taught by others. The best sort of originality is obviously that which adds something 
to the fund of knowledge made available by the tradition of learning. Ignorance or 
neglect of the tradition is likely to result in a false or shllow originality. 
The great books in all fields of learning are, in some good sense of the word, "original" 
communications. These are the books which are usually called "classics," but that word 
has for most peopoe a wrong and forbidding connotation！wrong in the sense of 
referring to antiquity, and forbidding in the sense of sounding unreadable. Great books 
are being written today and were written yesterday, far from being unreadable, the great 
books are the most readable and those which most deserve to be read. 
 - 4 - 
What I have said so far may not help you to pick out the great books from all others on 
the shelves. I fact, I shall postpone stating the criteria which betoken a great book！
criteria which also help you tell good books from bad！until much later (in Chapter 
Sixteen, to be precise). I might seem logical to tell a person what to read before telling 
him how, but I think it is wiser pedagogy to explain the requirements of reading first. 
Unless one is able to read carefully and critically, the criteria for judging books, 
however sound they may be in themselves, are likely to become in use just arbitrary 
rules of thumb. Only after you have read some great books competently will you have 
an intimate grasp of the standards by which other books can be judged as great or good. 
If you are impatient to know the titles of the books which most competent readers have 
agreed upon as great, you can turn now to the Appendix in which they are listed; but I 
would advise waiting until you have read the discussion of their characteristics and 
contents in Chapter Sixteen. 
There is, however, one thing I can say about the great books here. This may explain 
why they are generally readable, even if it does not explain why they should be 
generally read. They are like popularizations in that most of them are written for 
ordinary men and not for pedants of scholars. They are like textbooks in that they are 
intended for beginners and not for specialists or advanced students. You can see why 
that must be so. To the extext that they are original, they have to address themselves to 
an audience which starts from scratch. There is no prerequisite for reading a great book 

except another great book in the tradition of learning, by which the later teacher may 
have himself been taught. 
Unlike textbooks and popularizations, the great books assume an audience of readers 
who are thoroughly competent to read. That is one of their major distinctions, and 
probably why they are so little read today. They are not only original communcations, 
rather than digests or repetitions, but unlike the latter they do not go in for spoon-
feeding. they say: "Here is knowledge worth having. Come and get it." 
The proliferation of textbooks and lecture courses in our educational system today is the 
surest sign of our declining literacy. Truer than the quip that those who can't teach, 
teach teachers, is the insight that teachers who cannot help their students read the great 
books write textbooks for them, or at least use those their colleagues have written. A 
textbook or manual might almost be defined as a pedagogical invention for geting 
"something" into the heads of those who cannot read well enough to learn more 
actively. An ordinary classroom lecture is a similar device. When teachers no longer 
know how to perform the function of reading books with their students, they are forced 
to lecture at them instead. 
Textbooks and popularizations of all sorts are written for people who do not know how 
to read or can read only for information. As dead teachers, they are like the live 
secondary teachers who wrote them. Alive or dead, the secondary teacher tries to impart 
knowledge without requiring too much or too skillful activity on the part of learner. 
Theirs is an art of teaching which demands the least art of being taught in the students. 
They stuff the mind rather than enlighten it. The measure of their success is how much 
the sponge will absorb. 
Our ultimate goal is understanding rather than information, though information is a 
necessary steppingstone. Hence we must go to the primary teachers, for they have 
understanding to give. Can there be any question that the primary teachers are better 
sources of learning than the secondary ones? Is there are any doubt that the effort they 
demand of us leads to the vital cultivation of our minds? We can avoid effort in learning 
, but we cannot avoid the results of effortless learning.！the assorted vagaries we collect 
by letting secondary teachers indoctrinate us. 
If, in the same college, two men were lecturing, one a man who had discovered some 
truth, the other a man who was repeating secondhand what he had heard reported of the 
first man's work, which would you rather go to hear? Yes, even supposing that the 
repeater promised to make it a little simpler by talking down to your level, would you 
not suspect that the secondhand stuff lacked something in quality or quantity? If you 
paid the greater price in effort, you would be rewarded by better goods. 
It happens to be the case, of course, that the most of the primary teachers dead！the 
men are dead, and the books they have left us are dead teachers！whereas most of the 
living teachers are secondary. But suppose that we could resuscitate the primary 
teachers of all times. Suppose there were a college or university in which the faculty 
was thus composed. Herdotus and Thucydides taught the history of Greece, and Gibbon 
lectured on the fall of Rome. Plato and St. Thomas gave a course in metaphysics 
together; Francis Bacon and John Stuart Mill discussed the logic of science; Aristotle, 
Spinoza, and Immanuel Kant shared the platform on moral problems; Machivelli, 
Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke talked about politics. 
You could take a series of courses in mathematics form Euclid, Descartes, Riemann, 
and Cantor, with Bertrand Russell and A.N. Whitehead added at the end. You could 

listen to St. Augustine and William James talk about the nature of man and the human 
mind, with hperhaps Jacques Maritain to comment on the lectures. Harvey discussed the 
circulation of the blood, and Galen, Claude Bernard, and Haldane taught general 
physiology. 
Lectures on physics enlisted the talent of Galileo and Newton, Faraday and Maxwell, 
Planck and Einstein. Boyle, dalton, Lavosier, and Pasteur taught chemistry. Darwin and 
Mendel gave the main lectures on evolution and genetics, with supporting talks by 
Bateson and T.H. Morgan. 
Aristotle, sir Philip Sidney, Wordsworth, and Shelley discussed the nature of poetry and 
the principle of literary criticism, with T.S. Eliot thrown in to boot. In economics, the 
lecturers were by Adam smith, Ricardo, Karl Marx, and Marshall. Boas discussed the 
human race and its races, Thorsetin Veblen and John Dewey, the economic and political 
problems of American democracy, and Lenin lectured on communism. 
Etienne Gilson analyzed the history of philosophy, and Poincar└ and Duhem, the history 
of science. There might even be lectures on art by Leonardo da Vinci, and a lecture on 
Leonardo by Freud. Hobbes and Locke might discuss Ogden and Richards, Korzybski 
and Stuart Chase. A much larger faculty than this is imaginable, but this will suffice. 
Would anyone want to go to any other university, if he could get into this one? There 
need be no limitation of numbers. The price of admission！the only entrance 
requirement！is the ability and willingness to read. This school exists for everybody 
who is willing and able to learn from first-rate teachers, they theybe dead in the sense 
of not joining us out of our lethargy by their living presence. They are not dead in any 
other sense. If contemporary America dismisses them as dead, then, as a well-known 
writer recently said, we are repeating the folly of the ancient Athenians who supposed 
that Socrates died when he drank hemlock. 
The great books can be read in or out of school. If they are read in school, in classes 
under the supervision of live teachers, the latter must properly subordinate themselves 
to the dead ones. We can learn only from our intellectual betters. The great books are 
better than most living teachers as well as their students. 
The secondary teacher is simply a better student, and he should regard himself as 
learning. from the masters along with his younger charges. He should not act as if he 
were the primary teacher, using a great books as if it were just another textbook of the 
sort one of his colleagues might write. He should not masquerade as one who knows 
and can teach by virtue of his original disvoceries, if he is only one who has learned 
through being taught. The primary sources of his own knowledge should be the primary 
sources of learning for his students, and such a teacher functions honestly only if he 
does not aggrandize himself by coming between the great books and their young 
readers. He should not "come between" as nonconductor, but he should come between 
as a mediator！as one who helps the less competent make more effective contacts with 
the best minds. 
All this is not news, or, at least, it should not be. For many centuries, education was 
regarded as the elevation of a mind by its betters. If we are honest, most of us living 
teachers should be willing to admit that, apart from the advantages which age bestows, 
we are not much better than our students in intellectual caliber or attainment. If 
elevation is to take place, better minds than ours will have to do the teaching. That is 
why, for many centuries, education was thought to be produced by contact with the 
great minds of past and presents. 

There is only one fly in the ointment. We, the teachers, must know how to read for 
understanding. Our students must know how. Anyone, in school or out, must know 
how, if the formula is to work. 
But, you may say, it isn't as simple as that. These great books are too difficult for most 
of us, in school or out. That is why we are forced to get our education from secondary 
teachers, from classroom lectures, textbooks, popularizations, which repeat and digest 
for us what would otherwise forever remain a closed book. Even though our aim be 
understanding, not infomation, we must be satisfied with a less rich diet. We suffer 
incurable limitations. The masters are too far above us. It is certainly better to gather a 
few crumbs which dropped from the table than to starve in futile adoration of the feast 
we cannot reach. 
This I deny. For one thing, the less rich diet is likely not to be genuinely nourishing at 
all, if it is predigested food which can be passively acquired and only temporarily 
retained rather than actively assimilated. For another, as Professor Morris Cohen once 
told a class of his, the pearls which are dropped before real swine are likely to be 
imitation. 
I am not denying that the great books are likely to require more arduous and diligent 
effort than the digests. I am only saying that the latter cannot be substituted for the 
former, because you cannot get the same thing out of them. They may be all right fi all 
you want is some kind of information, but not if it is enlightment you seek. There is no 
royal road. The path of true learning is strewn with rocks, not roses. Anyone who insists 
upon taking the easierway ends up in fool's paradise！a bookful blockhead, ignorantly 
read, a sophomore all his life. 
At the same time, I am saying that the great books can be read by every man. The help 
he needs from secondary teachers does not consist of the get-learning-quick substitutes. 
It consists of help in learning how to read, and more than that when possible, help 
actually in the course of reading the great books. 
Let me argue a bit further the point the great books are the most readable. In some 
cases, of course, they are difficult to read. They require the greatest ability to read. Their 
art of teaching demands a corresponding and proportionate art of being taught. But, at 
the same time, the great books are the most competent to instruct us about the subject 
matters with which they deal. If we had the skill necessary to read them well, we would 
find them the easiest, because the most facile and adequate, way to master the subject 
matters in question. 
There is something of a paradox here. It is due to the fact that two different kinds of 
mastery are involved. There is, on the one hand, the author's mastery of his subject 
matter; on the other, there is our need to master the book he has written. These books 
are recognized as great because of their mastery, and we rate ourselves as readers 
according to the degree of our ability to master these books. 
If our aim in readingis to gain knowledge and insight, then the great books are the most 
readable, both for the less and for the more competent, because they are the most 
instructive. Obviously I do not mean "most readable" in the sense of "with the least 
effort"！even for the expert reader. I mean that these books reward every degree of 
effort and ability to the maximum. I may be harder to dig for gold than for potatoes, but 
each unit of successful effort is more amply repaid. 

The relation between the great books and their subject matters, which makes them what 
they are, cannot be changed. That is an objective and unalterable fact. But the relation 
between the original competence of the beginning reader and books which most 
deserve to be read can be altered. The reader can be mase more competent, through 
guidance and practice. To the extent that this happens, he is not only more able to read 
the great books, but, as a consequence, comes nearer and nearer to understanding the 
subject matter as the masters have understood it. Such mastery is the ideal of education. 
It is the obligation of secondary teachers to facilitate the approach to this ideal.

In writing this book I am a secondary teacher. My aim is to help and mediate. I am not 
going to read any books for you to save you trouble of reading them yourself. this book 
has only two functions to perform: to interest you in the profit of reading and to assist 
you in cultivating the art. 
If you are no longer in school, you may be forced to use the services of a dead teacher 
pf the art, such as this book. And no how-to-do book can ever be as helpful, in as many 
ways, as a good living guide. It may be just a little harder to develop skill when you 
have to practive according to the rules you find in a book, without being stopped, 
corrected, and shown how. But it certainly can be done. Too many men have done it to 
leave the possibility in doubt. It is never too late to begin, but we all have reason to be 
vexed with a school system which failed to give us a good start early in life. 
The failure of schools, and their responsibility, belong to the next chapter. Let me end 
this one by calling your attention to two things. The first is that you have learned 
something about the rules of reading. In earlier chapters you saw the importance of 
picking out important words and sentences and interpreting them. In the course of this 
chapter you have followed an argument about the readability of the great gooks and 
their role in education. Discovering and following an author's argument is another step 
in reading. I shall discuss the rule for doing so more fully later. 
The second point is that we have now pretty well defined the purpose of this book. It 
has taken many pages to do that, but I think you can see why it would have been 
unintelligible if I had stated it in the first paragraph. I could have said: "This book is 
intended to help you develop the art of reading for understanding, not information; 
therefore, it aims to encourage and assist you in reading the great books." But I do not 
think you would have known what I meant. 
Now you do, even though you may still have some reservations about the profit or 
significance of the enterprise. You may think there are many books, other than the great 
ones, which are worth reading. I agree, of couse. But you must admit in turn that the 
better the book, the more it is worth reading. Furthermore, if you learn how to read the 
great books, you will have no difficulty in reading other books, or for that matter 
anything else. You can use your skill to go after easier game. May I remind you, 
however, that the sportsman doesn't hunt lame ducks? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER FIVE 
The Defeat of the Schools 
 - 1 - 
In the course of the preceding chapters, I said somethings about the school system 
which are libelous unless they are true. But if true they constitute a grave indictment of 
the educators who viloated a public trust. Though this chapter may seem like a long 
discussion from the business of teaching you how to read, it is needed to explain the 
sitiuation in which most of us find ourselves or our children！"educated" but illiterate. 
If the schools were doing their job, this book would not be necessary. 
So far I have spoken largely from my own experience as a teacher in high school, 
college, and university. But you need not take my uncorroborated word for the 
deplorable failures of American education. There are many other witnesses who can be 
called to the stand. Better than ordinary witnesses, who may also speak from their own 
experience, there is eomething like scientific evidence on the point. We can listen to the 
experts report the results of tests and measurements. 
As far back as I can remember, there have been complaints about the schools for not 
teaching the young to write and speak well. The complaints have focused mainly on the 
products of high school and college. An elementary-school diploma never was expected 
to certify great competence in these matters. But after four or eight more years in 
school, it seemed reasonable to hope for a disciplined ability to perform these basic acts. 
English courses were, and for the most part still are, a staple ingredient in the high-
school curriculum. Until recently, freshman English was required course in every 
college. These courses were supposed to develop skill in writing the mother tongue. 
Though less emplasized than writing, the ability to speak clearly, if not with eloquence, 
was also supposed to be one of the ends in view. 
The complaints came from all sources. Businessmen, who certainly did not expect too 
much, protested the incompetence of the youngsters who came their way after school. 
Newspaper editorials by the score echoed their protests and added a voice of their own, 
expressing the misery of the editor who had to blue-pencil the stuff college graduated 
passed across his desk. 
Teachers of freshman English in college have had to do over again what should have 
been completed in high school. Teachers of other college courses have complained 
about the impossibily slopy and incoherent English which students hand in on term 
papers or examinations. 
And anyone who has taught in the graduate school or in a law school knows that a B.A. 
from our best colleges means very little with reference to a students skill in writing or 
speaking. Many candidate for the Ph.D. has to be coached in the writing of his 
dissertation, not from the point of view of scholoarship or scientific merit but with 
respect to the minimum requirements of simple clear, straightforward English. My 
colleagues in the law school frequently cannot tell whether a student does or does not 
know the law because of his inability to express himself coherently on a point in issue. 
I have mentioned only writing and speaking, not reading. Untill very recently, no one 
paid much attention to the even greater or more prevalent incompetence in reading, 
except, perhaps, the law professors who, ever since the introduction of the case of 
method of studying law, have realized that half the time in a law school must spent in 

teaching the student how to read the cases. They thought, however, that this burden 
rested perculiarly on them, that there was something very special about reading cases. 
They did not realize that if college graduates had a decent skill in reading, the more 
specialized technique of reading cases could be acauired in much less than half the time 
now spent 
One reason for comparative neglect of reading and the stress on writing and speaking is 
a point I have already mentioned. Writing and speaking are, for most people, so much 
activities than reading is. Seince we associate skill with activity, it is a natural 
consequence of this error to attribute defects in writing and speaking to lack of 
technique, and to suppose that failure in reading must be dute moral defects！to lack of 
industry rather than of skill. The error is gradually being corrected. More and more 
attention is being paid to the problem of eraind. I do not mean that the educators have 
yet discovered what to do about it, but they have finally realized that the schools are 
failing just as badly, if not worse, in the matter of reading, as in writing and speaking. 
It should be obvious at once that these skills are related. They are all arts of using 
language in the process of communication, whether initiating it or receiving it. We 
should not be surprized, therefore, if we find a positive correlation among defects in 
these several skills. Without the benefit of scientific research by means of educatiional 
measurements, I would be willing to predict that someone who cannot write well cannot 
read well either. In fact, I would go further. I would wager that his inability to read is 
partly responsible for his defects in writing. 
However difficult it may be to read, it is easier than writing and speaking well. To 
communicate well to others, one must know how communications are received, and be 
able, in addition, to master the medium to produce the desired effects. Though the arts 
of teaching and being taught are corrrelative, the teacher, either as writer or speaker, 
must prevision the process of being taught in order to direct it. He must, in short, be able 
to read what he writes, or listen to what he says, as if he wre being taught by it. When 
teach rs themselves do not possess the art of being taught, they cannot be very good 
teachers. 
 - 2 - 
I do not have to askj yo to accept my unsupported prediction or to meet my wager in the 
blind. The experts can be called to tesify in the light of scientific evidence. The product 
of our schools has been measured by the accredited apparatus of achievement tests. 
These tests touch all sorts of academic accomplishment！standard areas of information, 
as well as the basic skills, the three R's. They show not only that the high-school 
graduate is unskilled but also that he is shockingly uninformed. We must confine our 
attention to the defects of skill and especialy to reading, although the finding on writing 
and speaking are supporting evidence that the high-school graduate is generally at sea 
when it comes to any aspect of communication. 
This is hardly a laughing matter. However deplorable it may that those who have gone 
through twelve years of schooling should lack rudimentary information, how much 
more so is it that they should be disbarred from using the only means that can remedy 
the situatiion. If they could read！not to mention write and speak！they might be able 
to inform themselves throughout their adult life. 
Notice that the defect which the tests discover is in the easier type of reading！reading 
for information. For the most part, the tests do not even measure ability to read for 
understanding. If they did, the results would cause a riot. 

Last year Profesor James Mursell, of Columbia's Teachers of College, wrote an article 
in The Atlantic Monthly, entitled "The Defeat of Schools." He based his allegation on 
"thousands of investigations" which comprise the "consistent testimony of thirty years 
of enormously varied research in education." A large mass of evidence comes from a 
recent survey of the schools of Pennsylvania carried on by the Carnegie Foundation. Let 
me quote his own words: 
What about English? Here, too, there is a record of failure and defeat. Do pupils in 
school learn to read their mother tongue effectively? Yes and no. Up to the fifth and 
sixth grade, reading, on the whole, is effectively ttaught and well learned. To that level 
we find a steady and general improvement, but beyond it the curves flatten out to a dead 
level. This is not because a person arrives at his natural limit of efficiency when he 
reaches the sixth grade, for it has been shown again and again that with special tuition 
much older children, and also adults, can make enormous improvement. Nor does it 
mean that most sixth-graders read well enough for all practical purposes. A great many 
pupils do poorly in high school because of sheer ineptitude in getting meaning from the 
printed page. They can improve; they need to improve; but they don't. 
The average high-school graduates has done a great deal of reading, and if he goes on to 
college he will do a great deal more; but he is likely to be poor and incompetent reader. 
(Note that this holds true of the average student, not the person who is a subject for 
special remedial treatment.) He can follow a simple piece of fiction and enjoy it. But put 
him up against a closely written exposition, a carefully and economically stated 
argument, or a passage requiring critical consideration, and he is at a loss. It has been 
shown, for instance, that the average high-school student is amazingly inept at 
indicating the central thought of a passage, or the levels of emphasis and subordination 
in an argument or exposition. To all intents and purposes he remains a sixth-grade 
reader till well along in college. 
Even after he has finished college, I must add, he is not much better. I think it is true 
that no one can get through college who cannot read for information with reasonable 
efficiency. It may even be that he could not get into college were he thus deficient. But 
if we keep in mind the distinction between the types of reading, and remember that the 
tests measure primarily the ability to do the simpler sort, we cannot take much 
consolation from the fact that college students read better than sixth-graders. Evidence 
from the graduate and professional schools tends to show that, so far as reading for 
understanding is concerned, they are still sixth-graders. 
Professor Mursell writes even more dismally of the range of reading in which the 
schools succeed in engaging the interest of students: 
 
Pupils in school, and also high-school and college graduates, read but little. Medium-
grade magazines and fair-to-medium fiction are the chief standbys. Reading choices are 
made on hearsay, casual recommendations, and display advertising. Education is clearly 
not producing a discriminating or venturesome reading public. As one investigator 
concludes, there is no indication "that the schools are developing permanent interest in 
reading as a leisure-time activity." 
 

It is somewhat sanguine to talk about students and graduates reading the great books, 
when it appears that they do not read even the good nonfiction books which come out 
every year. 
I pass rapidly over Mursell's further report of the facts about writing: that the average 
student cannot express himself "clearly, exactly, and orderly in his native tongue"; that 
"a great many high-school pupils are not able to discriminate between what is a 
sentence and what is not"; that the average student has an impoverished vocabulary. "As 
one goes from senior year in high school to senior year in college, the vocabulary 
content of written English hardly seems to increase at all. After twelve years in school a 
great many students still use English in many respects childish and undeveloped; and 
four years more bring slight improvement." These facts have bearing on reading. The 
student who cannot "express find and precise shades of meaning" certainly cannot 
detect them in the expression of anyone else who is trying to communicate above the 
level of subtlety which a sixth-grader can grasp. 
There is more evidence to cite. Recently the Board of Regents of New York State 
solicited an inquiry into the achievement of its schools. This was carried out by an 
commission under the supervision of Professor Luther Gulick of Columbia. One of the 
volumes of the report treats of the high schools, and in this a section is devoted to the 
"command of the tools learning." Let me quote again: 
Large numbers even of the high school graduates are seriously deficient in the basic 
tools of learning. The tests given to leaving pupils by the Inquiry included a test of 
ability to read and understand straightforward English... The passages presented to the 
pupils consisted of paragraphs taken from simple scientific articles, historical accounts, 
discussions of economic probles, and the like. The test was originally constructed for 
eighth grade pupils. 
They discovered that the average high-school senior could pass a test designed to 
measure an achievement proper in the eighth grade. This is ceratainly not a remarkable 
victory for the high schools. But they also discovered that "a disturbingly large 
proportion of New York State boys and girls leave the secondary schools, -even go to 
higher schools,！without having attained a desirable minimum." One must agree with 
their sentiment when they say that "in skills which everyone must use"！such as 
areading and writing！"everyone should have at least a minimum of competence." It is 
clear that Professor Mursell is not using language too strong when he speaks of "the 
defeat of the schools." 
The Regents' Inquiry investigated the kind of learning which high-school students do by 
themselves, apart from school and courses. This, they rightly thought, could be 
determined by their out-of-school reading. And they tell us, from their results, "that 
once out of school, most boys and girls read soley for recreation, chiefly in magazines 
of mediocre or inferior fiction and in daily newspapers." The range of their reading, in 
school and out, is woefully slight and of the simplest and poorest sort. Nonfiction is out 
of the question. They are not even acquainted with the best novels published during 
their years in school. They know the names only of the most obvious best sellers. 
Worse than that, "once out of school, they tend to let books alone. Fewer than 40 per 
cent. of the boys ans gilrs interviewed had read any book or any part of a book in the 
two weeks preceding the interviews. Only one in ten had read nonfiction books." For 
the most part, they read magazines, if anything. And even here the level of their reading 
is low: "fewer than two young people in a hundred read magazines of the type of 
Harper's, Scribner's, or The Atlantic Monthly." 

What is the cause of this shocking illiteracy? The Regentsts' Inquiry report points its 
finger at the heart of the trouboe when it says that "the reading habits of these boys and 
girls are no doubt directly affected by the fact that many of them have never learned to 
read understandingly." Some of them "apparently felt that they were completely 
educated, and that reading was therefore unnecessary." But, for the most part, they do 
not know how to read, and therefore they do not enjoy reading. The possession of skill is 
an indispensable condition of its use and enjoyment in its exercise. In the light of what 
we know about their general inability to read！for understanding and even, in some 
cases, for information！it is not surprsing to discover the limited range of reading 
among high-school graduates, and the poor quality of what they do read. 
The serious consequences are obvious. "The inferior quality of reading done by large 
numbers of these boys and girls," this section of the Regents' report concludes, "offers 
not great hope that their independent reading will add very much to their educational 
stature." Nor, from what we know of the achievement in college, is the hope for the 
college graduate much greater. He is only little more likely to do much serious reading 
after he graduates, because he only a little more skilled in reading after four more years 
spent in educational institutions. 
I want to repeat, because I want to remember, that however distressing these findings 
may seeem, they are not half as bad as they would if the tests were themselves more 
severe. The tests measure a relatively simple grasp of relatively simple passages. The 
questions the students being measured must answer after they have read a short 
paragraph call for very little more than a precise knowledge of what the writer said. 
They do not demand much in the way of interpretation, and almost nothing of critical 
judgment. 
I say that the tests are not severe enough, but the standard I would set is certainly not 
too stringent. Is it too much to ask that a student be able to read a whole book, not 
merely a paragraph, and report not only what was said therein but show an increased 
understanding of the subject matter being discussed? Is it too much to expect from the 
schools that they train their students not only to interpret but to criticize; that is, to 
discriminate what is sound from error and falsehood, to suspend judgment if they are 
not convinced, or to judge with reason if they agree or disagree? I hardly think that such 
demands would be exorbitant to make of high school or college, yet if such 
requirements were incorporated into tests, and a satisfactory performance were the 
condition of graduation, not one in a hundred students now getting their diplomas each 
June would wear the cap and gown. 
 - 3 - 
You may think that the evidence I have so far presented is local, being restricted to New 
York and Pennsylvania, or that it places too much weight on the average or poorer high-
school student. That is not the case. The evidence represents what is going on in the 
country generally. The schools of New York and Pennsylvania are better than average. 
And the evidence includes the best high-school seniors, not merely the poorer ones. 
Let me suupse this last statement by one other citation. In June, 1939, the University of 
Chicago held a four-day conference on reading for teachers attending the summer 
session. At one of the meetings, Professor Diederich, of the department of education, 
reported the results of a test given at Chicago to top-notch high-school seniors who 
came there from all parts of the country to complete for scholarships. Among other 
things, these candidates were examined in reading. The results, Professor Diederich told 

the thousand teachers assembled, showd that most of these very "able" students simply 
could not understand what they read. 
Moreover, he went on to say, "our pupils are not getting very much direct help in 
understanding what they read or hear, or in knowing what they mean by what they say 
or write." Nor is the situation limited to high schools. It applied equally to colleges in 
this country, and even in England concerning the linguistic skill of undergratuates in 
Cambridge University. 
Why are the students not getting any help? It cannot be because the professional 
educators are unaware of the situation. That conference at Chicago ran for four days！
with many papers presented at morning , afternoon, and evening sessions！all on the 
problem of reading. It must be because the educators simply do not know what to do 
about it; in addition, perhaps, because they do not realize how much time and effort 
must expected to teaech students how to read, write, and speak well. Too many other 
things, of much less importance, have come to clutter up the curriculm. 
Some years ago I had an experience which is illuminating in this connection. Mr. 
Hutchins and I had undertaken to read the great books with a group of hihg-school 
juniors and seniors in the experimental school which the university runs. This was 
thought to be a novel "experiment" or worse, a wild idea. Many of these books were not 
being read by college juniors and seniors. They were reserved for the delectation of 
graduate students. And we were going to read them with high-school boys and girls! 
At the end of the first year, I went to the principal of the high school to report on our 
progress. I said that these younger students were clearly interested in reading the books. 
The questions they asked showed that. The acuteness and vitality of their discussion of 
matters raised in class shoed that they were better than older students who had been 
dulled by years of listening to lectures, taking notes, and passing examinations. They 
had much more edge than college seniors or graduate students. But, I said, it was 
perfectly obvious that they did not know how to read a book. Mr. Hutchins and I, in the 
few hours a week we had with them, could not discuss the books and also teach them 
how to read. It was a shame that their native talents were not being to trained to perform 
a function that was plainly of the highest educational importance. 
"What was the high school doing about teaching students how to read?" I asked. I 
developed that the principal had been thinking about this matter for some time. He 
suspected that the students couldn't read very well, but there wasn't time in the program 
for training them. He enumerated all the more important things they were doing. I 
refrained from saying that, if the students knew how to read, they could dispense with 
most of these courses and learn the same thing by reading books. "Anyway," he went 
on, "even if we had the time, we couldn't do much about reading until the school of 
education has finished its researches on the sobject." 
I was puzzled. In terms of wha I knew about the art of reading, I could not imagine what 
kind of experimental research was being done that migh help the students learn to read 
or their teachers to train them in doing so. I knew the experimental literature on the 
subject very well. There have been thousands of investigations and countless reports to 
constitute the "psychology of reading." They deal with eye movements in relation to 
different kinds of type, page layout, illumination, and so forth. They treat of other 
aspects of optical mechanics and sensory acuity or disability. They consist of all sorts of 
tests and measurementss leading to the standardization of achievement at different 
educational levels. And there have been both laboratory and clinical studies which bear 
on the emotional aspects of reading. Psychiatrists have found out that some children get 

into emotional tantrums about reading, as others do about mathematics. Sometimes 
emotional difficulties seem to cause reading disability; sometimes thy result from it. 
All of this work has, at best, two practical applications. The tests and measurements 
facilitate school administration, the classification and the gradation of students, the 
determination of the efficiency of one or another porcedure. The work on emotions and 
the senses, especially the eye, in its movements and as an organ of vision, has led to the 
therapeutic program which is part of "remedial reading." But none of this work even 
begins to touch on the problem of how to teach the young the art of reading well, for 
enlightment as well as information. I do not mean that the work is useless or 
unimportant, or that remedial reading may not save a lot of children from the most 
serious disabilities. I mean only that it has the same relation to making good readers as 
the development of proper muscular coordination has to the development of a novelist 
who must use his and eye in penmanship or typewriting. 
One example may make this point clear. Suppose you want to learn how to play tennis. 
You go to a tennis coach for lessons in the art. He looks you over, watches you on the 
court for while, and then, being an unusually discriminating fellow, he tells you that he 
connot teach you. You have a corn on your big toe, and papilloma on the ball of one 
foot. Your posture is generally bad, and you are muscle-bound in your shoulder 
movements. You need glasses. And, finally, you seem to have jitters whenever the ball 
comes at you, and a tantrum whenever you miss it. 
Go to a chiropodist and a osteopath.. Have a masseur get you relaxed. Get your eyes 
attended to, and your emotions straightened out somehow, with or without the aid of 
psychoanalysis. Do all these things, he says, and then come back and I'ii try to teach you 
how to play tennis. 
The coach who said this would not only be discriminating but sound in his judgment. 
There would be no point in trying to instruct you in the art of tennis while you were 
sufering from all these disabilities. The educational psychologists have made this sort of 
contribution. They have diagnosed the disabilities which prevent of hinder a person 
from learning how to read, better than the coach, they have devised all sorts of therapy 
which contribute to remedial reading. But when all this work is done, when the 
maximum in therapy is accomplished, you still have to learn how to read or play tennis. 
The doctors who fix your feet, prescribe your glasses, corect your posture, and relieve 
your emotional tensions cannot make you into a tennis player, though they transform 
you from a person who cannot learn how to one who can. Similarly, the psychologists 
who diagnose your reading disabilities and presecribe their cure do not know how to 
make you a good reader. 
Most of this educational research is merely preliminary to the main business of learning 
to read. It spots and removes obstacles. It help cure disability, but it does not remove 
inability. At best it makes those who are abnormal in one way or another more like the 
normal person whose native gifts nmake him freely susceptible training 
But the normal individual has to be trained. He is gifted whth the power to learn, but he 
is not born with the art. That must be cultivated. The cure of abnormality may overcome 
the inequalities of birth or the accidents of early development. Even if it succeeded in 
making all men approximately equal in their initial capacity to learn, it could go no 
further. At that point, the development of skill would have to begin. Genuine 
instructioin in the art of reading begins, in short, where the educational psychologists 
leave off. 

It should begin. Unfortunately, it does not, as all the evidence shows. And, as I have 
already suggested, there are two reasons why it is not. First, the curriculum and the 
educational program in general, from grammar school through college, is too croweded 
with other time-consuming things to permit enough attention to be geven the basic 
skills. Second, most educators do not seem to know how to teach the art of reading. The 
three R's exist in the curriculum today only in their most rudimentary form. Theya re 
regarded as belonging to the primary grades, instead of extending all the way up to the 
bachelor's degree. As a result, the bachelor of arts is not much more competent in 
reading and writing than a sixth-grader. 
 - 4 - 
I would like to discuss these two reasons in a little more detail. With respect to the first, 
the issue is not whether the three R's belonging in education, but to what extent they 
belong and how far they must be developed. Everyone, even the most extreme 
progressive educator, admits that children must be given the basic skills, must be taught 
to read and write. But there isn't general agreement about how much skill is the absolute 
minimum for an educatted man to possess, and how much educational fime it would 
take to give the minimim to the average student. 
Last year I was invited to participate in a national boradcast on the Town Meeting hour. 
The subject was education in a democracy. The other two participants were Professor 
Gulick of Columbia and Mr. John Studebaker, national commissioner of education. If 
you heard the broadcast, or read the pamphlet containing the speeches, you observed 
that there appeared to be agreement all of us about the three R's as indispensable traininf 
gor democratic citizenship. 
The agreement was only apparent ans superficial, however. For one thing, I meant by 
the three R's, the arts of reading, writing, and reckoning as these should be possessed by 
a bachelor of those arts; whereas my colleagues meant only the most rudimentary sort of 
grammar-school training. For another thing, they mentioned such things as reading and 
writing as only a few of the many ends which education, especially in a democracy, 
must serve. I did not deny that reading and writing are only a part and not the whole, but 
I did disagree about the order of importance of the several ends. If one could enumerate 
all the essentials which a sound educational program consider, I would say that the 
techniques of communication, which make for literacy, are our first obligation, and 
more so in a cemocracy than in any other kind of society, because it depends on a 
literate electorate. 
This is the issue in a nutshell. First things should come first. Only after we are assured 
that we have adequately accomplished them is there any time or energy for less 
important considerations. That, however, is not the way things are done in the schools 
and colleges today. Matters of unequal importance are given equal attention. The 
relaitvely tirvial is often made the whole of an education program, as in certain colleges 
which are little better than finishing schools. What used to be regarded as 
extracurricular activity has seized the conter of the stage, and the basic curricular 
elements are piled up somewhere in the wings, marked for cold storage or the junkman. 
In this process, begun by the elective system and completed by the excesses of 
progressive educatioin, the basic intellectual disciplines got pushed into a corner or off 
the stage entirely. 
In their false liberalism, the progressive educators confused discipline with 
regimentation, and forgot that true freedom is impossible without a mind made free by 
discipline. I never tire of quoting John Dewy at them. He said long ago: "The discipline 

that is identical with trained power is also identical with freedom... Genuine freedom, in 
short, is intellectual; it rests in the trained power of thought." A discipline mind, trained 
in the poer of thought, is one which can read and write critically, as well as do efficient 
work in discovery. The art of thinking, as we have seen, is the art of learning through 
being taught or through unaided research. 
I am not saying, let me repeat, that knowing how to read and learning through books are 
the whole of education. One should also be able to carry out investigation intelligently. 
Beyond that one should be well informed in all the areas of fact which are a necesary 
groundwork for thinking. There is no reason why all these things cannot be 
accomplished in the educational time at our disposal. But if one had to make a choice 
among them, one should certainly place the primary emphasis on the fundmental skills 
and let information of any sort take send place. Those who make the opposite choice 
must regard an education as a burden of fact one requires in school and tries to carry 
around for the rest of life, though the baggage becomes heavier as it progressively 
proves less useful. 
the sounder view of education, it seems to me, is one which emphasizes discipline. In 
this view, what one gets in school is not so much learning as the technique of learning, 
the arts of educating oneself through all the media the environment affords. Institutions 
educate only if they enable one to continue learning forever after. The art of reading and 
the technique of research are the primary instruments of learning, of being taught 
thnings and of finding them out. That is why they must be primary objectives of a sound 
educational system. 
Although I do not disagree with Carlyle that "all that a university or final highest school 
can do for us is still what the first school began,！teach us to read," I do agree with 
Professor Tenney of Cornell that if the school does teach students to read, it has placed 
in their hands "the primary instrument of all higher education. Thereafter, the student, if 
he so wills, can educate himself." If the schools taught their pupils to read well, they 
would make students of them, and students they would be out of school and after it as 
well. 
Let me call your attention, in passing, to a fault of reading which many persons commit, 
especially professors. A writer says he thinks sonething is of primary importance, or 
more important than something else. The bad reader interprets him as saying that 
nothing else but the thing he stresses is important. I have read many reviews of 
President Hutchin's Higher Learning in America which have stupidly or even viciously 
mistaken in his insistence upon literacy as indispensable to liberal or general education 
for an exclusion of everything else. To affirm, as he does clearly, that nothing else 
comes first is not to deny that other things come second, third, and so forth. 
What I have been saying will probably be similarly misinterpreted by the professors or 
the professionals in education. They will probably go further, and charge me with 
neglecting "the whole man" because I have not discussed the discipline of emotion in 
education and the formation of moral character. Every character that is not discussed is 
not necessarily denied, however. It that were the implication of omissions, writing about 
any one subject would involve infinite possibilites of error. This books is about reading, 
not about everything. The context should therefore indicate that we are primarily 
concerned with intellectual educatiion, and not the whole education. 
If I were asked, as I was from the floor on the night of the Town Meeting broadcast, 
"Which do you consider the most important to a student, the three R's or a good moral 
character? I would answer, as I did then: 

The choice between the intellectual and the moral virtues is a hard one to make; but if I 
had to make the choice, I would choose the moral virtues always, because the 
intellectual virtues without the moral virtues can be vicious misused, as they are 
misused by anyone who knoelwdge and skill, but doesn't know the ends of life. 
Knowledge and skill of mind are not the most important items in this life. Loving the 
right things is more important. Education as a shole must consider more than man's 
intellect. I am saying only that , in so far as it concerns then intellect, there is nothihg 
more important than the skills by which it must be disciplined to function well. 
 - 5 - 
I turn now to the second reason why the schools have failed in the matter of reading and 
writing. The First reason was that they underestimated the importance and extent of the 
task, and hence misconceived the relatively greater time effort which must be devoted to 
it than to anything else. The second is that the arts have been almost lost. The arts I am 
referring to now are the liberal arts which once were called grammaer, logic, and 
rhetoric. These are the arts which a B.A. is supposed to be a bachelor of, and an M.A. a 
master. These are the arts of reading and writing, speaking and listening. Anyone who 
knows anything about the rules of grammar, logic, and rhetoric knows that they govern 
the operations we perform with language in the process of communication. 
The various rules of reading, to which I have already more or less explicitly referred, 
involve points of grammar or logic or rhetoric. The rule about words and terms, or the 
one about sentences and propositions, has a grammatical and logical aspect. The rule 
about proof and other types of argument is obviously logical. The rule about interpreting 
the emphasis a writer places on one thing rather than another entails rhetorical 
considerations. 
I shall discuss these different apspects of the rules of reading later. Here the only point 
is that the loss of these arts is in large part responsible for our inability to read and 
toteach students how to read. It is highly significant that when Mr. I.A. Richards writes 
a book about Interpretation in Teaching, which is really a book one some aspects of 
reading, he finds it necessary to resuscitate the arts, and to divide his treatment into 
three main parts: grammar, rhetoric, and logic. 
When I say that the arts are lost, I do not mean that the sciences of grammar and logic, 
for instance, are gone. There are still grammarians and logicians in the universities. The 
scientific study of grammar and logic is still pursued, and in some quaters and under 
certain auspices with renewed vigor. You have probably heard about the "new" 
discipline which has been advertized lately under the name "semantics." It is not new, of 
course. It is also as old as Plato and Aristotle. It is nothing but new name for the 
scientific study of the rinciples of linguistic usage, combining grammatical and logical 
considerations. 
The ancient and medieval grammarians, and an eighteenth-century writer such as John 
Locke, could teach the contemporary "semanticists" a lot of principles they do not 
know, principles they need not try to discover if they would and could read a few books. 
It is interesting that, just about the time when grammar has almost dropped out of the 
grammar school, and when logic is a course taken by few college students, these studies 
should be revived in the graduate schools with a great fanfare of original discovery. 
The reivval of the study of grammar and logic by the semanticists does not alter my 
point, however, about the loss of the arts. There is all the difference in the world 

between studying science of something and practicing the art of it. We would not like to 
served by a cook whose only merit was an ability to recite the cookbook. It is an old 
saw that some logicians are the least logical of men. When I say that the linguistic arts 
have reached a new low in contemnporary education and culture, I am referring to the 
practice of grammar and logic, not to acquaintance with these sciences. The evidende 
for my statement is simply that we cannot write and read as well as men of other ages 
could, and that we cannot teach the next generation how to do so, either. 
It is a well-known fact that those periods of European culture in which men were least 
skillful in reading and writing were periods in which the greatest hullabaloo was raided 
about eh unitelligibility of everything that had been written before. This is what 
happened in the decadent Hellenictic period and in the fifteenth century, and it is 
happening again today. When men are incompetent in reading and writing, their 
inadequacy seems to express itself in their being hypercritical about everybody else's 
writing. A psychoanalyst would understand this as a pathological projection of one's 
own inadequacies on to others. The less well we are able to use words intelligibly, the 
more likely we are to blame others for their unintelligible speech. We may even make a 
fetish of our nightmares about language, and then we become semanticists for fair. 
The poor semanticists! They do now know what they are confessing about themselves 
when they report all the books they unable to understand. Nor does semantics seem to 
have helped them when, after practicing its rituals, they still find so many passages 
uninteligible. It has not helped them to become better readers than they were before they 
supposed that "semantics" had the magic of "sesame." If they only had the grace to 
assume that the trouble was not with the great writers of the past and present, but with 
them as readers, they might give semantics up or, at least, use it to try to learn how to 
read. If they could read a little better, they would find that the world conatined a much 
larger number of intelligible books than they now suppose. As matters now stand for 
them, there are almost none. 
 - 6 - 
The fact that the liberal arts are no longer generally practiced, in school or out, is plain 
from its consequence: namely, that students do not learn to read and write, and teachers 
do not know how to help them. But the cause of this fact is complicated and obscure. To 
explain how we got the way we are today, educationally and culturally, would probably 
require an elaborate history of modern times from the fourteenth century on. I shall be 
content to offer two incomplete and superficial explanations of what has happened. 
The first is that science is the major achievement of modern times. Not only do we 
worship for all the comforts and utitlties, all the command over nature, which it 
bestowes, but we are captivated by its method as the elixir of knowledge. I am not going 
to argue(though I think it true) that the experimental method is not the magic key to 
every masnsion of knowledge. The only point I wish to make is that, under such cultural 
auspieces, it is natural for education to emphasize the kind of thinking and learning the 
scientist does, either to the neglect or to the total exclusion of all others. 
We have come to disdain the kind of learning which consists in being taught by others, 
in favor of the kind which discovering things for ourselves. As a result, the arts 
appropriate to the first kind of learning, such as the art of reading, are neglected, while 
the arts of independent inquiry flourish. 
The second explanation is related to the first. In the age of science, which is 
progressively discovering new things and adding to our knowledge every day, we tend 

to think that the past can teach us nothing. The great books on the shelves of every 
library are of antiquarian interest only. Let those who wish to write the history of our 
culture dabble in them, but who are concerned to know about ourselves, the aims of life 
and society, and the world of nature in which we live, must either be scientists or read 
the newspaper reposrts of the most recent scientific meeting. 
We need not bother to read the great works of scientists now dead. They can teach us 
nothing. The same attitude soon extends to philosophy, to moral, political, and 
economic problems, to the great histories that were written before the latest researches 
were completed, and even to the field of literary criticism. The paradox here is that we 
thus come to disprage the past even in fields which do not employ the experimental 
method and cannot be affected by the changing content of experimental findings. 
Since, in any gemeration, only a few great books ge written, most of the great ones 
necessarily belong to the past. After we have stopped reading the great ones of the past, 
we soon do not even read the few great ones of the present, and content ourselves with 
second- and third-hand accounts of them. There is a vicious circle in all this. Because of 
our preoccupation with the present moment and the latest discovery, we do not read the 
great books of the past. Because we do not this sort of reading, and do not think it is 
important, we do not bother about trying to learn to read difficult books. As a result, we 
do not learn to read well at all. We cannot even read the great books of the present, 
though we may admire them from the distance and through the seven veils of 
popularization. Lack of exercise breeds flabbiness. We end up by not being able to read 
even the good popularizations as well. 
The cicious circle is worth looking at more closely. Just as you cannot improve your 
tennis game by playing only against opponents you can readily beat, so you cannot 
improve your skill in reading unless you work on something that taxes your effort and 
demands new resources. It follows, therefore, that in proportion as the great books have 
fallen from their traditional place as major sources of learning, it has become less and 
less possible to teach students how to read. You cannot cultivate their skill abouve the 
low level of their daily practice. You cannot teach them how to read well if, for the most 
part, they are not called upon to use the skill in its highest forms. 
So much for the vicious circle as it moves in one direction. Now, coming around the 
other way, we find there is not much point in trying to read the great books with 
students who have no preaparation at all in the art of reading from their prior schooling 
and are not getting any in the rest of their education. That was the trouble with the 
Honors cours at Columbia in my day, and I suspect it still is the case with similar 
reading courses now given there. 
In one course, which takes a small part of the students' time, you cannot discuss the 
books with him and also teach him how to read them. This is especially true if he comes 
from an elementary and secondary schooling which has paid little attention even to the 
rudiments of reading skill, and if the other courses in college which he is taking 
concurently make no demands on his ability to read for enlightment. 
That has been our experience here in Chicago, too. Mr. Hutchins and I have been 
reading the great books with students these last ten years. For the most part, we have 
failed if our aim was go tive these students a liberal education. By a liberally educated 
student, one who deserves the degree of bachelor of liberal arts, I mean one who is able 
to read well enough to read the great books and who has in fact them read well. If that is 
the standrad, we have seldom succeeded. The fault may be ours, of course, but I am 
more inclined to think that we could not, in one course out of many, overcome the 

inertia and lack of preparation due to the rest of the antecedent and concurrent 
schooling. 
The reform of education must start far below the college level and it must take place 
radically at the college level itself, if the art of reading is to become well developed and 
the range of reading is to be adequately by the time the bachelor's degree awarded. 
Unless that does happen, the bachelor's degree must remain a travesty on the liberal arts 
from which it takes its name. We will continue to gradute, not liberal artists bu 
chaotically informed and totally undisciplined minds. 
There is only one college that I know of in this country which is trying to turn out 
liberal artists in the true sense. That is St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. There 
they recognize that four years must be spent in training students how to read, write, and 
reckon, and how to observe in a laboratory, at the same time that they are reading the 
great books in all fields. There they realize that there is no point trying to read the books 
without developing all the arts needed to read them, and likewise that it is impossible to 
cultivate these basic intellectual skills without at the samt time giving the right matter 
toexercise them on. 
They have many handicaps to overcome at St. John's, but not lack of interest in the 
students or unwillingness to do the work which is required of no other college students 
today. The students do not feel that their sacred liberties are being trampled on because 
they do not have the freedom of elective choices. What is good for them educationally is 
prescribed. The students are interested and are doing the work. But one of the major 
handicap is that the students come to St. John's from high schools which turn them out 
totally unprepared. Another is the inability of the American public, the parents as well 
as the educators, to appreciate what St. John's is trying to do for American education. 
This is the deplorable state of American education today, despite the pronouncements 
and programs of some of its leaders. 
President Butler has writter eloquently, in his annual reports and elsewhere, of the 
primary importance of such intellectual disciplines as manifest themselves in good 
writing and reading. He has summarized the truth about the tradition of learning in a 
single pragraph: 
Only the scholar can realize how little that is being said and thought in the modern 
world is in anys sense new. It was the colossal triumph of the Greeks and Romans and 
of the great thinkers of the middle ages to sound the depths of almost every problem 
which human nature has to offer, and to interpret human thought and human aspiration 
with astounding profundity and insight. Unhappily, these deep-lying facts which should 
be controlling in the life of a civilized people, are known only to few, while the many 
grasp, now at an ancient and well-demonstrated falsehood ahd how at an old and well-
proved truth, as if each had all the attractions of novelty. 
The many need not be unfortunate, if schools and colleges trained them to read and 
made them read the books which constitute their cultural heritage. But it is not being 
done, certainly not to any extent, at Columbia or Harvard, at Princeton, Yale, or 
California. It is not being more spoken than Dr. Butler, and has been unquestionably 
explicit in his plan for the reform of the college curriculum so that the ends of liberal 
education may ve served. 
Why? There are many causes, not the least of which are such familiar ones as the inertia 
of vested interests; the devotion of most college teachers to competence in some field of 

specialized research rather than in general or liberal education; and undue magnification 
of the scientific method and its latest findings. But one other cause, certainly, is general 
apathy about this whole business of reading, an apathey which comes, I think, from an 
equally general lack of understading of what is involved. I have often wondered if the 
situation could be changed until the faculties themselves had learned to read the great 
books and had read them！not the rew which belong to their own academic niche, but 
all of them. 
 - 7 - 
The situation I have described exists not only in school but outside as well. The public 
is paying for the education; it must be satisfied with what it is getting. The only way 
that one can account for the failure of the public to rise up in arms is that it doesn't care 
or that it really doesn't understand what's wrong. I cannot believe the first. It must be 
the second. An educational system and the culture in which it exists tend to perpetuate 
each other. 
There is a vicious circle here too. Perhaps it can be broken by adult education, by 
making the adult population aware of what is wrong with the schools they went through 
and to which they are now sending their children. One of the first thing to do is to make 
them appropriate what a liberal education could be in terms of skill reading and writing, 
and the profit in books to be read. I would rather try to overcome their apathy than to 
addres myself to some of my colleagues in the educational business. 
That the general public is also apathetic about reading cannot be questioned. You know 
it, and do not have to be told. The publishers know it also. It might interest you to 
eavesdrop on the publishers talking about you, the general public, their trade. Here is 
one addressing his fellow publishers in their weekly trade journal. 
He begins by saying that "college graduates who do not know how to read constitute a 
major indictment of American educational methods, and a constant challenge to the 
country's publishers and booksellers. Large numbers college educators do know how to 
read, but there are far too many whose acute reading apathy might be described as an 
occupational disease. 
He knows what the trouble is: "Students are taught by teachers who are themselves 
victims of the same educational process, and who openly or sub-consciously have a 
positive distaste for disinterested reading... Instead of stepping forth as an eager 
candidate for continuing education, who should look forward to a lifetime of learning 
and reading after commencement, we get an unripe bachelor of arts, who is scarcely an 
adult and who shuns education like the plague." 
He calls upon the publishers and booksellers to do their share in winning the nation 
back to books, and concludes thus: 
If the five million college graduates of this country increased their book-reading time by 
even as little as ten percent., the results would be tremendous. If people generally 
changed their intellectual fuel or re-charged their mental batteries with same reggularity 
they devoted to changing motor oil every thousand miles, or replacing frayed playing 
cards, there might be something like a rebirth of learning in our republic... As it is, we 
are distinctly not a book-reading country. We wallow in magazines, and drug ourselves 
with movies... 

People sometimes marvel at spectacular best-sellers like The Outline of History, The 
Story of Philosophy, The art of Thinking, or Van Loon's Geography！books which sell 
in hundreds of thousands, and sometines reach a million readers. My comment is "Not 
enough!" I look at the census figures, and behold the intellectual apathy of most college 
men, and exclaim "Wait till the graduates begin reading!" I applaud Walter B. Pitkin's 
commencement day advice. "Don't sell your books and keep yor diplomas. Sell your 
diplomas, if you can get anyone to buy them, and keep your books." 
To sum it all up, too many men and women use their college degrees as an official 
license to "settle down" in an intellectual rut, as a social sanction exempting them from 
thinking their own thoughts, and buying their own books. 
 
Another publishers says, "millions of people who can read and do read newspapers and 
magazines never read books." He figures out they might be induced to read books if 
they were only made a little more like magazine articles！shorter, simpler, and designed 
in general for those who like to run while reading. This enter rise, called The People's 
Library, and described as "a scientific effort to increase the reading of serious books," 
seems to me to defeat its own avowed purpose. You cannot elevate people by going 
down to their level. If they succeed in geting you there, there they will keep you, for it is 
easier to get you to stay down than for them to move up. 
Not by making books less like books, but by making people more like readers, must be 
the change be effected. The plan behind The People's Library is as blind to the causes of 
the situations its sponsors are trying to cure as the people are at Harvard who complain 
about the rampant tutoring schools, without realizing that the way to remedy that evil is 
to lift the Harvard education above the level where the turoting schools can prepare 
students more efficiently for ene examinations than the faculty can. 
The publishers are not concerned so much about the reading of the great books as about 
the good new books they would like to publish if they could find readers for them. But 
they know！or if they don't, they should！that these two things are connected. The 
ability to read for enlightment, and consequent upon that the desire to do so, is the sine 
qua non of any serious reading. It may be that the causal sequence works either way. 
Starting with good current books, a reader may be lead to the great books, or vice versa. 
I am sure that the readr who does one will eventually do the other. I would guess that 
the probability of this doing either is higher if he has ever once read a great book 
through and with suficient skill to enjoy his mastery fo the subject mattter. 
 - 8 - 
This has been a long jeremiad. There has been much weping and gnashing of teeth 
about the state of the nation. Because you just dislike the words, you may despari of "a 
new deal," or maybe you are the hopeless type who says, "'Twas ever thus." On the 
latter point. I must disagree. There have been times in European history when the level 
of reading was higher than it is now. 
In the late Middle Ages, for instance, there were men who could read better than the 
best readers today. Of couse, it is true that there were fewer men who could read, that 
they had fewer books to read, and that they depended upon reading more than we do as 
a source of learning. The point remains, however, that they mastered the books they 
valued, as we mastered nothing today. Maybe we do not respect any book as they 
valued the Bible, the Koran, or the Talmud; a text of Aristotle; a dialogue of Plato; or 

the Institute of Justinian. However that may be, they developed the art of reading to a 
higher point than it ever reacherd before or since. 
We must get over all our funny prejudices about the Middle Ages and go to the men 
who wrote exegeses of Scripture, glosses on Justinian, or commentaries on Aristotle for 
the most perfect models of reading. These glosses and commentaries were not 
condensations or digests. They were analytical and interpretative readings of a wrothy 
text. In fact, I might as well confess here that I have learned much of what I know about 
reading from examining a medieval commentary. The rules I am going to prescribe are 
simply a formulation of the method I have observed in watching a medieval teacher read 
a book with his students. 
Compared to the brilliance of thw twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the present era is 
much more like the dark ages of the sixth and the seventh centuries. Then the librarires 
had been burned or closed. There were few books available and fewer readers. Today, 
of course, we have more books and libraries than ever before in the history of man. In 
one sense, too, there are more men who can read. But it is the sense in which this is true 
that makes the point. So far as reading for understanding goes, the libraries might just as 
well be close and the printing presses stopped. 
But, you will say, we are libing in a democratic era. It is mnore important that many 
men should be able to read a little than a few men should be able to read well. There is 
some truth in that, but not the whole truth. Genuine participation in democratic 
processes of self-government requires greater literacy than many have yet been given. 
Instead of comparing the present with the late middle ages, let us make the comparison 
with the eighteenth century, for in its way that was a period of enlightenment which sets 
a relevant standard for us. The democratization of society had already then begun. The 
leaders of the movement, in this country and abroad, were liberally educated men, as no 
college graduate is today. The men who wrote and ratified the Constitution knew how to 
read and write. 
While we have properly undertaken to make the public education more widespread than 
it was in the eighteenth century education need not become less liberal as it becomes 
more universal. At every level and for all elements in the population, the same kind of 
education！for freedom through discipline！which enabled democracy to take root in 
this country must be regained if its flowering it to be protected today from the winds of 
violence abroad in the world. 
All you have to do is to read the writings os John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, of 
Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, to know that they could read and write better than we or 
our leaders can today. If you look into the curriculum of the colonial colleges, you may 
discover how this happened. You will discover that a liberal educatiion was once given 
in this country. True, not everyone received this liberal education. Democracy had not 
het matured to the point of widespread popular education. 
Even today it may true that some part of the population must be vocationally trained, 
while another part is liberally educated. For even a democracy must have leaders, and 
its safety depends on their caliber, their liberalism. If we do not want leaders who boast 
of thinking with their blood, we had better educate and, more than that, cultivate a 
respect for those who can think with their minds, minds liberated by discipline. 
One point more. There is a lot of talk today, among liberal educators who fear the rise 
of Fascism, about the dangers of regimentation and indoctrination. I have already 

pointed out that many of them confuse discipline with Prussian drill and the goose step. 
They confuse authority, which is nothing but the voice of reason, with autocracy or 
tyranny. But the error they make about indoctrination is the saddest. They, and most of 
us, do not know what docility is. 
To be docile is to be teachable. To be teachable one must have the art of being taught 
and must practice it actively. The more active one is in learning from a teacher, dead or 
alive, and the more art one uses to master what he has to teach, the more docile one is. 
Docility, in short, is the precise opposite of passivity and gullibility. Those who lack 
docility！the students who fall asleep during a class！are the most likely to be 
indoctrinated. Lacking the art of being taught, whether thath be skill in listening or in 
reading, they do not know how to be active in receiving what is communicated to them. 
Hence, they either receive nothing at all or what they receive they absorb uncritically. 
Slighting the three R's in the beginning, and neglecting the liberal arts almost entirely at 
the end, our present education is essentially illiberal. It indoctrinates rather than 
disciplines and educates. Our students are indoctrinated with all sorts of local prejudices 
and predigested pap. They have been fattened and made flabby for the demogogues to 
prey upon. Their resistance to specious authority, which is nothing but pressure of 
opinion, has been lowered. They will even swallow the insidious porpaganda in the 
headlines of some local newspapers. 
Even when the doctrines they impose are sound democratic ones, the schools fails to 
cultivate free judgement because they have forsaken discipline. They leave their 
students open to opposite indoctrination by more powerful orators or, what is worse, to 
the sway of their own worst passions. 
Ours is a demagogic rather than a democratic education. The student who has not 
learned to think critically, who has not come to respect reason as they only arbiter of 
truth in human generalizations, who has not been lifted out of the blind alleys of local 
jargons and shibboleths, will not be saved by the orator of the classroom from later 
succumbing to the orator of the platform and the press. 
To be saved, we must follow the precept of the Book Common Prayer: "Read, mark, 
learn, and inwardly digest." 
CHAPTER SIX 
On Self-help 
 - 1 - 
All my cards are on the table now. Now you know that I have an ulterior motive in 
writing a book designed to help people learn how to read. For years I have watched the 
vicious circle which perpetuates things as they and wondered how it could be broken. It 
has seemed hopeless. Today's teachers were taught by yesterday's, and they teach those 
of tomorrow. Today's public was educated in the schools of yesterday and today; it 
cannot be expected to demand that the schools change tomorrow. It cannot be expected 
to make demands if it does not know intimately, as a matter of its own experience, the 
difference between real education and all the current impostures. That "if' gave me the 
clue. Why couldn't it be made a matter of people's experience, instead of their having to 
rely on hearsay and all the crosscurrents of talk among disputing experts. 

It could. If somehow out of school and after it, people generally could get some of the 
education they did not get in school, they might be motivated, as they are not now, to 
blow up the school system. And they could get the education they did not get, if they 
could read. Do you follow this reasoning? The vicious circle would be broken if the 
general public were better educated than the standard product of the schools and 
colleges. It would break at the point where they would really know themselves the kind 
of literacy they would like their children to get. All the regular flimflam handed out by 
the educators could not talk them out it. 
No one can be taught reading, or any ather skill for that matter, who will not help 
himself. The help I, or anyone like me, may offer is insufficient. It is at best remote 
guidance. It consists of rules, examples, advice of all sorts. But you have to be willing to 
take advie and to follow rules. You can get no further than you take yourself. Hence, my 
diabolical plan will not work without your co-opeation in its early stages. Once I got 
you started reading, I would let nature take its course, and be fairly condifent about the 
ultimate outcome. 
I have a deep conviction that anyone who has had even a memorable taste of the kind of 
education. Mr. Hutchins is fighting for, and St. John's is trying to give, would want it for 
others. Certainly, he would want it for his children. It is not paradoxical that the most 
violent opposion to the program comes from professional educators who seem to have 
been least touched in their own lives by this type of education. 
More than educational reform is at stake. Democracy and the liberal institutions we 
have cherished in this country since its founding are in the balance, too. When Mr. 
Walter Lippmann first discovered a book on the Education of the Founding Fathers of 
the Republic, he was surprised that "the men who had made the modern world should 
have been educated in this old-fashioned way." The old-fashioned way is the way of arts 
of reading and writing, the way of reading the great books. 
Mr. Lippmann, who passed through Harvard very creditably, attributed his surprise to 
the fact that he had, naturally, enough, never challenged the standards of his generation. 
It must be said in his behalf, however, that since leaving Harvard he has read a great 
many books. That has some bearing on his insight: 
I began to think that perhaps it was very significant that men so educated had founded our liberties, and 
that we who are not so educated should be mismanaging our liberties and be in danger of losing them. 
Gradually I have come to believe that this fact is the main clue the the riddle of our epoch, and that men 
are ceasing to be fre because they are no longer being educated in the arts of free men. 
Do you see why I think there is dynamite in reading, not only enough to blow the school 
system but enough to furnish the arsenal for the protection of our liberties? 
 
 - 2 - 
I have hesitated some time before talking about self-help. In fact, I have hesitated some 
time about writing this book, because I have what is, perhaps, an irrational prejudice 
against self-help books. They have always sounded like patent-medicine advertisements 
to me. If only you will take this or that in small, regular doses, you will be cured of all 
your ills. The world will be saved. This means you. It all depends on you. In my 
academic serenity, I was once above and apart from such tawdry devices. When you 
write for your scholarly peers, you do not make such appeals, probably beause you 
would never think of expecting them to help themselves. 

Two things have brought me down form the tower. In the first place, it may be serene 
up there, but after your eyes have been opened to the sham and the delusion which 
perpetuate the serenity, it seems more like the stillness that sometimes pervades a 
madhouse. In the second place, I have seen the fruits of adult education. It can be done. 
And anyone who has worked in adult education knows that he must appeal for self-help. 
There are no monitors to keep adults at the task. There are no examinations and grades, 
none of the machinery of external discipline. The person who learns something out of 
school is self-disciplined. He works for merit in his own eyes, not credit from the 
registrar. 
There is only one caution I must add to keep the proceedings honest. Those self-help 
books which promise to do more than they can are bogus. No book, as I have said 
before, can direct you in the acquisition of a skill with as much efficiency as the tutor or 
coach who takes you by the hand and leads you through the motions. 
Let me state now, simply and briefly, the conditions under which you can effectively 
help yourself. Any art or skill is possessed by those who have formed the habit of 
operaitng according to its rules. In fact, the artist or craftsman in any field differs thus 
from those who lack his skill. He has a habit they lack. You know wht I mean by habit 
here. I do not mean drug addition. Your skill in playing golf or tennis, your technique in 
driving a car or cooking soup, is a habit. You acquired it by performing the acts which 
constitute the whole operation. 
There is no other way of forming a habit of operation than by operating. That is what it 
means to say one learns to do by doing. The difference between your activity before 
and after you have formed a habit is a difference in facility and readiness. You can do 
the same thing much better than when you started. That is what it meants to say practice 
makes perfect. What you do very imperfectly at first you gradually come to do with the 
kind of almost automatic perfection that an instinctive performance has. You do 
something as if you were to the manner born, as if the activity were as natural to you as 
walking or eating. That is what it means to say that habit is the second nature. 
One thing is clear. Knowing the rules of an art is not the same as having the habit. When 
we speak of a man as skilled in any way, we do not mean that he knows the rules of 
doing something, but that he possesses the habit of doing it. Of course, it is true that 
knowing the rules, more or less explicitly, is a condition of getting the skill. You cannot 
follow rules you do not know. Nor can you acquire an atristic habit！any craft or skill！
without following rules. the art as something which can be taught consists of rules to be 
followed in operation. The art as something which can be learned and possessed 
consists of the habit which results from operating according to the rules. 
Everything I have said so far about the acquisition of skill applies to the art of reading. 
But there is one difference between reading and certain other skills. To acquire any art 
yiou must know the rules in order to follow them. But yoy need not in every case 
understand the rules, or at least nor to the same degree. Thus, in learning to drive an 
automobile, you must know the rules but you do not have to know the principles of 
automotive mechanics which make them right. In other words, to understand the rules 
is to know more than the rules. It is to know the scientific principles which underlie 
them. If you wanted to be able to repair your car as well as drive it, you would have to 
know its mechanical principles, and you would under the rules of driving better than 
most drivers do. If understanding the rules were part of the test for driver's license, the 
automobile industry would suffer a depression that would make the last one look like a 
boom. 

The reasons for this difference between reading and driving is that the one more of an 
intellectuall, the other more of a mannual, art. All rules of art engage the mind in the 
activity they govern, of course; but the activity may not be principally an activity of the 
mind itself, as reading is. Reading, and writing, scientific research and musical 
composition, are intellectual arts. That is why it is more necessary for their practitioners 
not only to know the rules but to find them intelligible. 
It is more necessary, but it is not absolutely indispensable. It might be more accurate to 
say that it is a matter of degree. You must have some understanding of the rules of 
reading, if you are to form the the habit of this intellectual operation intelligently. but 
you need not understand them perfectly. If complete understanding were essential, this 
book would be a hoax. To understand the rules of reading perfectly, you would have to 
know the sciences of grammar, rhetoric, and logic with consummmate adequacy. Just 
as the science of automotive mechanics underlies the rules for driving and repairing 
cars, so the liberal sciences I have just named underlie the rules of liberal art which 
govern such things reading and writing. 
You may have observed that sometimes I speak of the arts of reading and writings as 
liberal arts, and sometimes I say the liberal arts are grammar, rhetoric, and logic. In the 
former case, I am referring to the operations which the rules direct us in performing 
well; in the latter, I am referring to the rules themselves which govern such operations. 
Further more, the fact that grammar and logic are sometimes regarded as science and 
sometimes as arts means that the rules of operation, which the arts prescribe, can be 
made intelligible by principles underlying the rules, which the science didscuss. 
It would take a book ten times as long as this one to expound the sciences which makes 
the rules of reading and writing intelligible. If you started to study the sciences for the 
sake ultimately of understanding the rules and forming the habits, you might never get 
to the rules or form the habits. That is what happens to many logicians and grammarians 
who have spent their lives studying the sciences. They do not learn how to read and 
write. That is why courses in logic as a science, even if they were required of all college 
students, would not do the trick. I have met many students who have spent years of 
genuine devotion to the science of logic who could not read and write very well; in fact, 
did not even know the rules of the art, not to mention the habit of good performance 
according the rules. 
The solution of this riddle is indicated. We shall begin with the rules！the precepts 
which are most directly and intimately regulative of the acts you must perform to read 
well. I shall try to make the rules as intelligible as possible in a brief discussion, but I 
shall not go into the intricacies and subtleties of scientific grammar or logic. Suffice it if 
you realize that there is much more to know about the rules than you are learning from 
this book, and that the more you know of their underlying principles, the better you will 
understand them. Perhaps, if you learn to read by reading this book, you will be able to 
later to read books about the sciences of grammar, rhetoric, and logic. 
I am satisfied that this is a sound procedure. It might not be generally so, but it must be 
so in the case of reading. If you do not know how to read very well to begin with, you 
cannot learn how by starting with scientific books about grammar and logic, because 
you cannot read them well enough either to udnerstand them in themselves or to make 
practical applications of them by formulating rules of operation for yourself. Getting 
this aspect of our undertaking clear removes another possibility of dishonesty or 
pretension. I shall always try to tell you if my explanation of a rule is superficial or 
inadequate, as necessarily some of them will be. 

I must caution you against one other thing. You will not learn to read just by reading 
this, any more than you can learn to drive a car by perusing a driver's maual. You under, 
I am sure, the point about the necessity of practice. you may think that you can start 
right off in this business of reading, as soon as you know the rules. If you think so, you 
are going to be disappointed. I want to prevent that because such frustrations may lead 
you to abandon the whold enterprise in despair. 
Do not take the list of rules in one hand, and a book to be read in the other, and try to 
perform at once as if you possessed the skill habitually. That would be as dangerous to 
your mental health as getting into an auto for the first time, with the wheel in one hand 
and a driving manual in the other, would be to your physical well-being. In both cases, 
an operation which is at first clumsy, disconnected, tedious, and painful becomes 
graceful and smooth, facile and pleasant, only through many hours of practice. If at first 
you do not succeed, the rewards of practice should induce you try again. Mr. Aaron 
Copland recently wrote a book on What to Listen for in Music. In its opening paragraph, 
he wrote: 
All books on understanding music are agreed about one point: You can't develop a better appreciation of 
the art merely by reading a book about it. If you want to understand music better, you can do nothing 
more important than listen to it. Nothing can possibily take the place of listening to music. Everything 
that I have to say in this book is said about an experience that you can only get outside this book. 
Therefore, you will probably be wasting your time in reading it unless you make a firm resolve to hear a 
great deal more music than you have in the past. All of us, professionals and nonprofessionals, are forever 
trying to deepen our understanding of the art. Rreading a book may sometimes help us. But nothing can 
replace the prime consideration！listen to music itself. 
Substitue the word "books" for "music," and "reading" for "listening," and you have the 
first and last word of advice about how to use the rules I am going to discuss. Learning 
the rules may help, but nothing can replace the prime consideration, which is reading 
books. 
You may ask: How will I know whether I am really following the rules when I read? 
How can I tell whether I am really making the right amount of effort toget cut of the rut 
of passive and sloppy reading? What are the signs which indicate that I am making 
progress toward reading more intelligently? 
There are many ways of answering such questions. For one thing, you should be able to 
tell whether you are getting the lift which comes from managing to understanding 
something which at first seemed unintelligible to you. For another, if you know the 
rules, you can always check your readings as one checks back on the sum of a column 
of figures. How many of the steps, which the rules prescribe, have you taken? You can 
measure your achievement in terms of the techniques you should have used to operate 
upoon a book better than yourself, whereby to elevate yourself to its level. 
The most direct sign that you have done the work of reading is fatigue. Reading that is 
reading entails the most intense mental activity. It you are not tired out, you probably 
have not been doing the work. Far from being passive and relaxing, I have always found 
what litle reading I have done the most arduous and active occupation. I often cannot 
read more than a few hours at a timne, and I seldom read much in that time. I usually 
find it hard work and slow work. There may be people who can read quickly and well, 
but I am not one of them. The point about speed is irrelevant. What is relevant is 
activity. To read books passively does not feed a mind. It makes blotting paper out of it. 
 

- 3 - 
By my own standards or good reading, I do not think I have read many books. I have, of 
course, obtained information from a large number. But I have not struggle for 
enlightment with many. I have reread some of those quite often, but that is somewhat 
easier than the original reading. Perhaps you will get my point if I tell you that now I 
probably do not read to understand more than ten books a year！that is, books I have 
not read before. I haven't the time I once had. It always was and still is the hardest work 
I do. I seldom do it in the living room in an easy chair, largely for fear of being seduced 
into relaxation and eventually sleep. I d it sitting up at my desk, and almost always with 
a pencil in hand and a pad at the side. 
That suggests another sign by which do tell whether you are doing the job of reading. 
Not only should it tire you, but there should be some discernible product of your 
memtal activity. Thinking usually tends to express itself overtly in language. One tends 
to verbalize ideas, questions, difficulties, judgements that occur in the course of 
thinking. If you have been reading, you must have been thinking; you have something 
you can express in words. One of the reasons why I find reading a slow process is that I 
keep a record of the little thing I do. I cannot go on reading the next page, if I do not 
make a memo of something which occurred to me in reading this one. 
Some people are able to use their memory in such a way that they need not bother with 
notes. Again, this is a matter of individual differences. I find it more efficient not to 
burden my memory while reading and to use the margins of the book or a jot a pad 
instead. The work of memory can be undertaken later and, of course, should be. But I 
find it easier not to let it interfere with the work of understanding which constitutes the 
main task of reading. If you are like me！rather than like thos who can keep on reading 
and remembering at the same time！you will be able to tell whether you have been 
reading actively by your pencil and paper work. 
Some people enjoy making notes on the back cover or the end papers of a book. They 
find, as I do, that this often saves them the trouble of an extra reading to rediscover the 
main points they had intended to remember. Marking a book or writing on its end 
papers may make you more reluctant to lend your books. They have become documents 
in your intellectual autobiography, and you may not wish t trust such records to any 
except the best of friends. I seldom feel like confessing so much about myself even to 
friends. But the business of making notes while reading is so important that you should 
not be deterred from writing in a book by the possible social consequences. 
If for the reason mention, or some other, you have prejudices against marking up a 
book, use a pad. If you read a borrowed book, you have to use a pad. Then there is 
theproblem of keeping your notes for future reference, on the assumption, of course, 
that you have made a significant record of your reading. I find writing in the book itself 
the most efficient and satisfying procedure during a first reading, although it is often 
necessary later to make extensive notes on separate sheets of paper. The later procedure 
is indispensable if your are organizing a fairly elaborate summary of the book. 
Whatever procedure you choosem you can measure yourself as a reader by examining 
what you have produced in notes during the course of reading a book. Do not forget, 
here as elsewhere, that theer is something more important than quantity. Just as there is 
reading and reading, so there is note taking and note taking. I am not recommending the 
kind of notes most students take during a lecture. There is no record of thought in them. 
At best, they are sedulous transcript. They are later become the occasion for what has 
been well described as "legalized cribbing and schoolboy plagiarism." When they are 

thrown away after examinations are over, nothing is lost. Intelligent note taking is 
probably as hard as intelligent reading. In fact, the one must be an aspect of the other, if 
the notes one makes while reading are record of thought. 
Every different opeartion in reading calls for a different step in thinking, and hence the 
notes one makes at various stages in the process should reflect the variety of intellectual 
acts one has performed. If one is trying to grasp the structure of a book, one may make 
several tentative outlines of its main parts in their order, before one is satisfied with 
one's apprehension of the whole. Schematic outlines and diagrams of all sorts are useful 
in disengaging the main points from supporting and tangential matters. If one can and 
will mark the book, it is helpful to underline the important words and sentences as they 
seem to occur. More than that, one should note the shifts inmeaning by numbering the 
places at which important words are used successively in different senses. If the author 
appears to contradict hinmself, some notation should be made of the places at which the 
inconsistent statements occur, and the contest should be marked for possible indications 
that the contradiction is only apparent. 
There is no point in enumerating further the variety of notations or markings that can be 
made. There will obviously be as many as there are things to do in the course of 
reading. The point here is simply that you can discover whether you are doing what 
should be doing by the note taking or markings which have accompanied your reading. 
One illustration of note taking may be helpful here. If I were reading the first few 
chapters of this book, I might have constructed the following diagram to keep the 
meaning os "reading" and "learning" clear, and to see them in relatio to one another and 
to other things: 
 Types of Reading: 
I. For amusement 
II. For knowledge 
A. For information 
B. For understanging 
 

 Types of Learning: 
I. By discovery: without teachers 
II. By instruction: through aid of teachers 
A. By live teachers: lectures; liestening 
B. By dead teachers: books; reading 
 
 

Hence Reading II (A and B) is Learning II (B) 
But books are also of different sorts: 
 Types of Books: 
I. Digests and repetitions of other books 
II. Original communications 
 

And it appears that: 
Reading II(A) is related more closely to Books I 
Reading II(B) is related more closely to Books II 
 

A scheme of this sort would give me a first grasp of some of the other important 
distinctions the author was making. I would keep a diagram of this sort before me as I 
read, to discover how much more filling-in it could take as the author proceed to 
mulitiply distinctions and to draw conclusions from premises he constructed in terms of 
these distinctions. Thus, for instance, the distinction between primary and secondary 
teachers might be added by corelating them with the two types of books. 
 
 - 4 - 
We are not prepared to proceed to the next part of this book in which the rules of 
reading will be discussed. If you carefully examined the Table of Contents before you 
started, you know that what lies ahead of you. If you are like many readers I know, you 
paid no attention to the Table of Contents or at best gave it a cursory glance. But Tables 
of Contents are like maps. They are just as useful in the first reading of a book as a road 
map is for touring in strange territory. 
Suppose you look at the Table of Contents again. What do you find? That the first part 
of this book, which you have now finished, is a general discussion of reading; that the 
second part is entirely devoted to the rules; that the thirs part considers the relation of 
reading to other aspects of one's life. (You will find all this in the Preface also.) 
You might even guess that in the next part each of the chapters, except the first, would 
be devoted to the statement and explanation of one or more rules, with examples of their 
practice. But you could not tell from the titles of these chapters how the rules were 
grouped into subsets and what was the relation of the various subordinate sets to each 
other. That, as a matter of fact, will be the business of the first chapter in the next part to 
make clear. But I can cay this much about it here. The different sets of rules relate to 
different ways in wich a book can be approached: in terms of its being a complicated 
structure of parts, having some of unity of organization; in terms of its linguistic 
elements; in terms of the relation author and reader as if they were engaged in 
conversation. 
Finally, you might be interested to know that there other books about reading, and what 
their relation is to this one. Mr I.A. Richards has written a long book, to which I have 
already referred, called Interpretation in Teaching. It is primarily concerned with rules 
of the second sort described above, and attempts to go much further than this book into 
the principles of grammar and logic. Professor Tenney of Cornell, who has also been 
mentioned, recently wrote a book callled Intelligent Reading which also deals primarily 
with rules of the second sort, though some attention is paid also to the third. His book 
suggests various exercises in the performance of relatively simple grammatical tasks. 
Neither of these books considers rules of the first sort, which means that neither of them 
faces the problem of how to read a whole book. They are rather concerned with the 
interpretation of small excerpts and isolated passages. 
Someone might suggest that recent books on semantics would also prove helpful. I have 
some doubts here, for reasons I have already indicated. I would almost say that most of 
them are useful only in showing how not to read a book. They approach the problem as 
if most books are not worth reading, especially the great books of the past, or even those 
in the present by authors who have not undergone semantic purification. That seems to 
me the wrong approach. The right maxim is like the one which regulates the trial of 
cirminals. We should assume that the author is intelligible until shown otherwise, not 
that he is guilty of nonsense and must prove his innocence. And the only way you can 

determine an author's guilt is to make the very best effort you can to understand him. 
Not until you have made such an effort with every available turn of skill have you a 
right to sin in final judgment on him. If you were an author yourself, you would realize 
why this is the golden rule of communication among them. 
 
PART II . 
 THE RULES 
 CHAPTER SEVEN 
From Many Rules to One Habit 
 -1- 
While you are in the stage of learning to read, you have to go over a book more than 
once. If it is worth reading at all, it is worth three reading at least. 
Lest you become unduly alarmed at the demands that are going to be made of you, let 
me hasten to say that the expert reader can do these three reading at the same time. 
What I have called "three readings" need not be three in time. They are, strictly 
speaking, three in manner. They are three ways of reading a book. To be well read, each 
book should be read in these three ways each time it is read. The number of distinct 
times you can read something profitably depends partly on the book and prtly on you as 
a reader, your resourcefulness and industry. 
Only at the beginning, I repeat, the three ways of reading a book must be done 
separately. Before you become expert, you cannot coalesce a lot of different acts into 
one complex, harmonious performance. You cannot telescope the different parts of the 
job so that they run into one another and fuse intimately. Each deserves your full 
atttention while you are doing it. After you have practice the parts seprately, you not 
only can do each with greater facility and less attention but you can also gradually put 
them toether into a smoothly running whole. 
I am saying nothing here which is not common knowledge about learning a complex 
skill. I merely want to be sure you realize that learning to read is at least as complex as 
learning to typewrite or leaning to play tennis. If you can recall your patience in any 
other learning experience you have had, perhaps you will be more tolerant of a tutor 
who is shortly going to enumerate a long list of rules for reading. 
The experimental psychologists have put the learning process under glass for any to 
look at. The learning curves they have plotted, during countless laboratory studies of 
every sort of manual skill, show graphically the rate of progress from one state of 
practice to another. I want to call your attention to two of their findings. 
The first is called the "learning plateau." During a series of days in which a 
performance, such as typewriting or receiving the Morse code telegraphically, is 
practiced, the curve shows improvement both in speed and in the reduction of errors. 
Then suddenly the curve flattens out. For some days, the learner cannot make any 
advances. His hard work seems to yield no substantial effects either in speed or 

accuracy. The rule that every bit of practice makes a little more perfect appears to break 
down. Then, just as suddenly, the learners gets off the plateau and starts to climb again. 
The curve which records his achievements again shows steady progress from day to 
day. And this continues, though perhaps with a slightly diminishing accelaration, until 
the learner his another plateau. 
Plateau are not found in all learning curves, but only in those which record progress in 
gaining a complex skill. In fact, the more complex the performance to be learned, the 
more frequency such stationary periods appear. The psychologists have discovered, 
however, that learning is going on during these periods, though it is hidden in the sense 
of having no manifest practice effects at the time. The discovery that "higher units" of 
skills are then being formed is the second of the two findings I referred to before. While 
the learner is improving in typing single letters, he makes progress in speed and 
accuracy. But he has to form the habit of typing syllables and words as units, and then 
later phrases and sentences. 
The stage during which the learner is passing from a lower to a higher unit of skill 
appears to be one of no advance in efficiency, because the learner must develop a 
certain number of "word units" before he can perform at that level. When he has enough 
of these units mastered, he makes a new spurt of progress until he has to pass to a higher 
unit of operation. What at first consisted of a larger number of single acts！the typing of 
each individual letter！becomes finally one complex act！the typing of a whole 
sentence. The habit is perfectly fromed only when the learner has reached the highest 
unit of operation. Where before there seemed to be many habits, which it was difficult 
to make work together, now there is one habit by virtue of the organization of all the 
separate acts into one smoothly flowing performance. 
The laboratory findings merely confirm what I think most of us know already from our 
own experience, though we might not have recognized the plateau as a period in which 
hidden learning is going on. If you are learning to play tennis, you have to learn how to 
serve the ball, how to receive your opponent's service or return, how to play net, or at 
the mid-court and base line. Each of these is part of the total skill. At first, each must be 
mastered separately, because there is a technique for doing each. But none of these by 
itself is the game of tennis. You have to pass from these lower units to the higher unit in 
which all the separate skills are put together and become one complex skill. You have to 
be able to move from one act to another so rapidly and automatically that our attention 
is free for the strategy of play. 
Similarly in the case of learning to drive a car. At first, you learn to steer, shift gears, 
apply the brake. Gradually these units of activity are mastered and lose their 
separateness in the proces of driving. You have learned to drive when you have learned 
to do all these together without thinking about them. 
The man who has done one experience in acquiring a complex skill knows that he need 
not fear the array of rules which present themselves at the beginning of something to be 
learned. He knows that the does not have to worry about all the different acts, in whch 
he must become seprately proficient, are going to work together. Knowing that the 
plateau is learning are periods of hidden progress may prevent discouragement. Higher 
units of activity are getting formed even if they do not increase one's efficiency all at 
once. 
The multiplicity of the rules indicates the complexity of the one habit to be formed, not 
the plurality of distinct habits. The part acts coalesce and telescope as each reaches the 
stage of automatic execution. When all the subordinate acts can be done more or less 

automatically, you have formed the habit of the whole performance. Then you can think 
about beating your opponent in tennis, or driving your car to the country. This is an 
important point. At the beginning, the learner pays attention to himself and his skill in 
the separate acts. When the acts have lost their separateness in the skill of the whole 
performance, the learner can at last pay attention to the goal which the technique he has 
acquired enables him to reach. 
 
 - 2 - 
What is true of tennis or driving holds for reading, not simply the grammar-school 
rudiments, but the highest type of reading for understanding. Anyone who recognizes 
that such reading is a complex activity will acknowledge this. I have made all this 
explicit so that you will not think that the demands to be made here are any more 
exorbitant or exasperating than in other fields of learning. 
Not only will you become proficient in following each of the rules, you will gradually 
cease to concern yourself with the rules as distinct and the separate acts they regulate. 
You will be doing a larger job, confident that the parts will take care of themselves. You 
will no longer pay so much attention to yourself as a reader, and be able to put your 
mind wholy on the book you are reading. 
But for the present we must pay attention to the separate rules. These rules fall into 
three main groups, each dealing with one of the three indispensable ways a book must 
be read. I shall now try to explain why there must be three readings. 
In the first place, you must be able to grasp what is being offered as knowledge. In the 
second place, you must judge whether what is being offered is really acceptable to you 
as knowledge. In the other words, there is first the task of understanding the book, and 
second the job of criticizing it. These two are quite separate, as you will see more and 
more. 
The process of understanding can be further divided. To understand a book, you must 
approach it, first, as a whole, having a unity and a structure of parts; and, second, in 
terms of its elements, its units of language and thought. 
Thus, there are three distinct readings, which can be rariously named and described as 
follows: 
I. The first reading can be called structural or analytic. Here the reader proceeds from 
the whole to its parts. 
II. The second reading can be called interpretative or synthetic. Here the reader 
proceeds from the parts to the whole. 
III. The third reading can be called critical or evaluative. Here the reader judges the 
author, and decides whether he agrees or disagrees. 
In each of these three main divisions, there are several steps to be taken, and hence 
several rules. You have already being introduced to three of the four rules for doing the 
second reading: (1) you must discover and interpret the most important words in the 
book; (2) you must do the same for the most important sentences, and (3) similarly for 
the paragraph which express arguments. The fourth rule, which I have not yet 

mentioned, is that you must know which of his problems the author solved, and which 
he failed on. 
To accomplish the first reading you must know (1) what kind of book it is; that is, the 
subject matter it is about. You must also know (2) what the book as a whole is trying to 
say; (3) into what parts that whole is divided, and (4) what the main problems are that 
the author is trying to solve. Here, too, there are four steps and four rules. 
Notice that the parts which you come to by analyzing the whole in this first reading are 
not exactly the same as the parts you start with to construct the whole in the second 
reading. In the former case, the parts are the ultimate divisions of the author's treatment 
of his subject matter or problem. In the latter case, the parts are such things as terms, 
propositions, and syllogisms; that is, the author's ideas, assertions, and arguments. 
The third reading also involves a nmumber of steps. There are first several general rules 
about how you must undertake the task of critism, and then there are a number of 
critical points you can make-- four in all. The rules for the third reading tell you what 
points can be made and how to make them. 
In this chapter, I am going to discuss all the rules in a general way. Later chapters take 
them up separately. If you wish to see a single, compact tabulation of all these rules you 
will find it on pages 266-7, at the opening of Chapter Fourteen. 
Though you will unerstand it better later, it is possible to show you here how these 
various reading will coalesce, especially the first two. That has already been somewhat 
indicated by the fact that both have to do with whole and parts in some sense. Knowing 
what the whole book is about and what its main divisions are will help you discover its 
leading terms and propositions. If you can discover what the chief contentions of the 
author are and how the supports these by argument and evidence, you will be aided in 
the determining the general tenor of his treatment and its major divisions. 
The lst step in the first reading is to define the problem or problems the author is trying 
to solve. The last step in the second reading is to decide whether the author has solved 
these problems, or which he has and which he has not. Thus you see how closely the 
first two readings are related, converging as it were in their final steps. 
As you become more expert, you will be able to do these two readings together. The 
better you can do them together, the more they will help each other get done. But the 
third reading will never become, infact never can become, absolutely simultaneous with 
the other two. Even the most expert reader must do the first two and the third somewhat 
separately. Understanding an author must always precede criticizing or judging him. 
I have met many "readers" who do the third raeding first. Worse than that, they fail to 
do the first two readings at all. They pick up a book and soon begin to tell you what is 
wrong with it. They are full of opinions which the book is merely a pretext for 
expressing. They can hardly be called "readers" at all. They are more like people you 
know who think a conversation is an occasion for talking but not listening. Not only are 
such people are not woth your effort in talking, but they are usually not worth listening 
either. 
The reason why the first two readings can grow together is that both are attempts to 
understand the book, whereas the third remains distinct because it undertakes criticism 
after understanding is reached. But even after the first two readings are habitually fused, 
they can still be analytically separated. This is important. If you had to check your 

reading of a book, you would have to divide thw whole process into its parts. You might 
have to re-examine separately each step you took, though at the time you did not take it 
separately, so habitual had the process of reading become. 
For this reason, it is important to remember that the various rules remain distinct from 
one another as rules even though they tend to lose their distinctness for you though 
causing you to form a single, complicated habit. They cound not help you check your 
reading unless you could consult them as so many different rules. The teacher of 
English composition, going over a paper with a student and explaining his marks, points 
to this or that rule the student violated. At that time, the student must be reminded of the 
different rules, but the teacher does not waant him to write with a rule sheet before him. 
He wants him to write well habitually, as if the rules were part of his nature. The same 
is true of reading. 
 
 - 3 - 
Now there is one further complication. Not only must you read a book three ways (and 
at the beginning that may mean three times), but you must also be able to read two or 
more books in relation to one another in order to read any one of them well. I do not 
mean that you must be able to read any collection of books together. I am thinking only 
of books which are related because they deal with the same subject matter or treat of the 
same group of problems. If you cannot read such books in relation to one another, you 
probably cannot read any one of them very well. If the authors are saying the same or 
different things, it they are agreeing or disagreeing, what assurance can you have that 
you understand one of them unless you recognize such overlappings and divergences, 
such agreements and disagreements? 
This point calls for a distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic reading. I hope these 
two words are not mislead ing. I know of no other way to name the difference. By 
"intrinsic reading" I mean reading a book in itself, quite apart from all other books. By 
"extrinsic reading" I mean reading a book in the light of other books. The other books 
may, in some cases, be only reference books, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, 
almanacs. They may be secondary books, which are useful commentaries or digests. 
They may be other great books. Another extrinsic aid to reading is relevant experience. 
The experiences to which one may have to refer in order to understand a book may be 
either of the sort that occur only in a laboratory, or of the sort which men possess in the 
course of their daily lives. Intrinsic and extrinsic reading tend to fuse in the actual proc--
ss of understanding, or even criticizing, a book. 
What I said before about being able to read related books in relation to one another 
applies especially to the great books. Frequently, in lecturing about education, I refer to 
the great books. Members of the audience usually write to me later to ask for a list of 
such books. I tell them to get either the list which the American Library Association has 
published under the title Classics of the Western World, or the list printed by St. John's 
College, in Annapolis, Maryland, as part of its announcement. Later I am informed by 
these people that they have great difficulties in reading the books. The enthusiasm 
which prompted them to send for the list and to start reading has given way to a 
hopeless feeling of inadequacy. 
There are two reasons for this. One, of course, is that they do not know how to read. But 
that is not all. The other reason is that they think they should be able to understand the 
first book they pick out, without having read the others to which it is closely related. 

They may try to read The Federalist Papers without having read the Articles of 
Confederation and the Constitution. Or they may try all these without having read 
Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, Rousseau's The Social Contract, and John Locke's 
essay Of Civil Government. 
Not only are many of the great books related, but they have actually been written in a 
certain order which should not be ignored. A later writer has been influenced by an 
earlier one. If you read the earlier writer first, he may help you understand the later 
book. Reading related books in relation to one another and in an order which renders the 
later ones more intelligible is a basic rule of extrinsic reading. 
I shall discuss the extrinsic aids to reading in Chapter Fourteen. Until then, we shall be 
concerned only with the rules of intrinsic reading. Again, I must remind you that we 
have to make such separations in the process of learning, even though the learning is 
completed only when the separations disappear. The expert reader has other books in 
mind, or relevant experiences, while he is reading a particular book to which these other 
things are related. But tor the present, you must pay attention to the steps in reading a 
single book, as if that book were a whole world in itself. I do not mean, of course, that 
your own experience can ever be excluded from the process of understanding what a 
book is saying. That much of extrinsic reference beyond the book is absolutely 
indispensable, as we shall see. After all, you cannot enter the world of a single book 
without bringing your mind along and with it the whole of your past experience. 
These rules of intrinsic reading apply not only to reading a book but to taking a course 
of lectures. I am sure that a person who could read a whole book well could get more 
out of a course of lectures than most people do, in or out of college. The two situations 
are largely the same, though following a series of lectures may call for a greater exercise 
of memory or note taking. There is one other difficulty about the lectures. You can read 
a book three times if you have to read it separately in each of three ways. That is not 
possible with lectures. Lectures may be all right for those who are expert in receiving 
communication, but they are liard on the untrained. 
This suggests an educational principle: perhaps it would be a sound plan to be sure that 
people knew how to read a whole book before they were encouraged to attend a course 
of lectures. It does not happen that way in college now. It does not happen in adult 
education either. Many people think that taking a course of lectures is a short cut to 
getting what they are not able to read in books. But it is not a short cut to the same goal. 
In fact, they might as well be going in the opposite direction. 
 - 4 C 
There is one limitation on the applicability of these rules, which should be already 
obvious. I have repeatedly stressed that they aim to help you read a whole book. At least 
that is their primary aim, and they would be misused if applied mainly to excerpts or 
small parts out of context. You cannot learn to read by doing it fifteen minutes a day in 
the manner prescribed by the guidebook which goes along with the Harvard Classics. 
It is not merely that fifteen minutes a day is somewhat 
insufficient but that you should not read a little piece here and a little part there, as the 
guidebook recommends. The Five-Foot Shelf contains many of the great books, 
although it also includes some that are not so great. In many cases, whole books are 
included; in others, substantially large excerpts. But you are not told to read a whole 

book or a large part of one. You are directed to taste a little nectar here and sniff a little 
honey there. That will make you a literary butterfly, not a competent reader. 
For example, one day you are to read six pages from the Autobiography of Benjamin 
Franklin; on the next, eleven pages of Milton's early lyrics, and on the next, ten pages of 
Cicero on friendship. Another sequence of days finds you reading eight pages by 
Hamilton from The Federalist Papers, then remarks by Burke on taste running fifteen 
pages, and then twelve pages from Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality. The only thing 
which determines the order is the historic connection between the thing to be read and a 
certain day of the month. But the calendar is hardly a relevant consideration. 
Not only are the excerpts far too short for a sustained effort of reading, but the order in 
which one thing follows another makes it impossible to grasp any real whole in itself or 
to understand one thing in relation to another. This plan for reading the Harvard 
Classics must make the great books about as unintelligible as a college course under the 
elective system. Perhaps the plan was devised to honor Dr, Eliot, the sponsor of both the 
elective system and the Five Foot Shelf. In any case, it offers us a good object lesson of 
what not to do if we wish to avoid intellectual St. Vitus's dance. 
 - 5 C 
There is one further limitation on the use of these rules. We are here concerned with 
only one of the major purposes in reading, and not the other！with reading to learn, and 
not with reading for enjoyment. The purpose is not only in the reader but in the writer as 
well. We are concerned with books which aim to teach, which seek to convey 
knowledge. In the early chapters I distinguished between reading for knowledge and for 
amusement, and restricted our discussion to the former. We must now go a step further 
and distinguish two large classes of books which differ according to the intention of the 
author as well as in the. satisfaction they can afford readers. We must do this because 
our rules apply strictly to one type of book and one type of purpose in reading. 
There are no recognized, conventional names for these two classes of books. I am 
tempted to call one sort poetry or fiction, and the other exposition or science. But the 
word "poetry" today usually means lyrics, instead of naming all imaginative literature, 
or what is sometimes called belles-lettres. Similarly, the word "science" tends to 
exclude history and philosophy, though both of these are expositions of knowledge. 
Names aside, the difference is grasped in terms of the author's intention: the poet, or any 
writer who is a fine artist, aims to please or delight, just as the musician and the sculptor 
do, by making beautiful things to be beheld. The scientist, or any man of knowledge 
who is a liberal artist, aims to instruct by speaking the truth. 
The problem of learning how to read poetical works well is at least as difficult as the 
problem of learning to read tor knowledge. It is also radically different. The rules which 
I have briefly enumerated and will presently discuss in detail are directions for reading 
to learn, not for adequately enjoying a work of fine art. The rules for reading poetry 
would differ necessarily. They would take a book as long as this to expound and 
explain. 
In their general ground plan, they might resemble the three divisions of the rules for 
reading scientific or expository works. There would be rules concerning the 
appreciation of the whole in terms of its being a unified structure of parts. There would 
be rules tor discerning the linguistic and imaginative elements that constitute a poem or 
story. There would be rules for making critical judgments about the goodness or 
badness of the work, rules which helped develop good taste and discrimination. Beyond 

that, however, the parallelism would cease, because the structure of a story and a 
science are so different; the linguistic elements are differently used to evoke 
imagination and to convey thought; the criteria of criticism are not the same when It is 
beauty rather than truth that is to be judged. 
T'he category of books which delight or amuse has as many levels of quality in it as the 
category of books which instruct. What is called "light fiction" requires as little ability 
to read, as little skill or activity, as books which are merely informative, and do not 
require us to make an effort to understand. We can read the stories in a mediocre 
magazine as passively as we read its articles. 
Just as there are expository books which merely repeat or digest what is better learned 
from the primary sources of enlightenment, so there is secondhand poetry of all sorts. I 
do not mean simply the twice-told tale, for all good tales are many times told. I mean 
rather the narrative or lyric which does not alter our sentiments or mold our 
imagination. In both fields, the great books, the primary books, are alike in being 
original works and our betters. As in the one case the great book is able to elevate our 
understanding, so in the other the great book inspires us, deepens our sensitivity to all 
human values, increases our humanity. 
In both fields of literature, only books which are better than we are require skill and 
activity in reading. We can read the other stuff passively and with little technical 
proficiency. The rules for reading imaginative literature, therefore, aim primarily to help 
people read the great works of belles-lettres！the great epic poems, the great dramas, 
novels, and lyrics！just as the rules for reading to learn aim primarily at the great works 
of history, science, and philosophy. 
I regret that both sets of rules cannot be adequately treated in a single volume, not only 
because both kinds of reading are necessary for a decent literacy, but because the best 
reader is one who possesses both sorts of skill. The two arts of reading penetrate and 
support each other. We seldom do one sort of reading without having to do a little of the 
other at the same time. Books do not come as neat and pure packages of science or 
poetry. 
The greatest books most frequently combine these two basic dimensions of literature. A 
Platonic dialogue such as The Republic must be read both as a drama and as an 
intellectual discourse. A poem such as Dante's The Diving Comedy is not only a 
magnificent story but a philosophical disquisition. Knowledge cannot be conveyed 
without the supporting texture of imagination and sentiment; and feeling and imagery 
are inveterately infected with thought. 
It remains the case, however, that the two arts of reading are distinct. It would be 
thoroughly confusing to proceed as if the rules we were going to expound applied 
equally to poetry and science. Strictly, they apply only to science or books conveying 
knowledge. I can think of two ways to compensate for the deficiency of this limited 
treatment of reading. One is to devote a chapter later to the problem of reading 
imaginative literature. Perhaps, after you have become acquainted with the detailed 
rules for reading non-fiction books, I will be possible to indicate briefly the analogous 
rules for reading fiction and poetry. I shall try to do this in Chapter Fifteen. In fact, I 
shall go further and there make the effort to generalize the rules so that they apply to 
reading anything. The other remedy is to suggest books on the reading of poetry or 
fiction. I shall name some here, and more later in Chapter Fifteen. 

Books which treat of the appreciation or criticism of poetry are themselves scientific 
books. They are expositions of a certain kind of knowledge, sometimes called "literary 
criticism"; viewed more generally, they are books like this one, trying to instruct in an 
art！in fact, a different aspect of the same art, the art of reading. Now if this book helps 
you learn how to read any kind of expository book, you can read these other books by 
yourself and be helped by them to read poetry or belles-lettres. 
The great traditional book of this sort is Aristotle's Poetics. More recently, there are the 
essays of Mr. T. S. Eliot, and two books by Mr. I. A. Richards, The Principles of 
Criticism and Practical Criticism. The Critical Essays of Edgar Allan Poe are worth 
consulting, especially the one on "The Poetic Principle." In his analysis of The Poetic 
Experience, Fr. Thomas Gilby illuminates the object and the manner of poetic 
knowledge. William Empson has written about Seven Types of Ambiguity in a way that 
is particularly helpful for reading lyric poetry. And recently, Gordon Gerould has 
published a book on How to Read Fiction. If you look into these books, they will lead 
you to others. 
In general, you will find the greatest help from those books which not only formulate 
the rules but exemplify them in practice by discussing literature appreciatively and 
critically. Here, more than in the case of science, you need to be guided by someone 
who actually shows you how to read by doing it for you. Mr. Mark Van Doren has just 
published a book called simply Shakespeare. It gives you his reading of the plays of 
Shakespeare. There are no rules of reading in it, but he provides you with a model to 
follow. You may even be able to detect the rules which governed him by seeing them in 
operation. There is one other book I would like to mention, because it bears on the 
analogy between reading imaginative and expository literature. Poetry and Mathematics 
by Scott Buchanan illuminates the parallel between the structure of science and the form 
of fiction. 
 - 6 - 
 
You may object to all this. You may say that I have forced a distinction where none can 
be drawn. You may say that there is only one way of reading all books, or that any book 
must be read in every way, if there are many ways. 
I have anticipated this objection by pointing out already that most books have several 
dimensions, certainly a poetic and a scientific one. I have even said that most books, and 
especially the great books, must be read in both ways. But that does not mean that the 
two kinds of reading must be confused, or that we must entirely ignore our primary 
purpose in reading a book or the author's chief intention in writing it. I think most 
authors know whether they are primarily poets or scientists. Certainly the great ones do. 
Any good reader should be aware of what he wants wherr he goes to a book: knowledge 
primarily, or delight. 
The further point is simply that one should satisfy one's purpose by going to a book 
written with a similar intention. If one seeks knowledge, it seems wiser to read books 
which offer to instruct, if there be such, than books which tell stories. If one seeks 
knowledge of a certain subject matter, one had better go to books which treat of it rather 
than others. It seems misguided to read a history of Rome, if it is astronomy one wishes 
to learn. 

This does not mean that one and the same book cannot be read in different ways and 
according to different purposes. The author may have more than one intention, although 
I think one is always likely to be primary and to dictate the obvious character of the 
book. Just as a book may have a primary and secondary character！as the dialogues of 
Plato are primarily philosophical and secondarily dramatic, and The Divine Comedy is 
primarily narrative and secondarily philosophical！so the reader may deal with the 
book accordingly. He may even, if he wishes, invert the order of the author's purposes, 
and read Plato's dialogues mainly as drama, and The Divine Comedy chiefly as 
philosophy. This is not without parallel in other fields. A piece of music intended to be 
enjoyed as a work of fine art can be used to put the baby to sleep. A chair intended to be 
sat upon can be placed behind ropes in a museum and admired as a thing of beauty. 
Such duplicity of purpose and such inversions of primary and secondary character leave 
the main point unchanged. Whatever you do in the way of reading, whichever purpose 
you put first or second, you must know what you are doing and obey the rules for doing 
that sort of thing. There is no error in reading a poem as if it were philosophy, or science 
as if it were poetry, so long as you know which you are doing at a given time and how 
to do it well. You will not suppose, then, that you are doing something else, or that it 
makes no difference how you do whatever you are doing. 
There are, however, two errors which must be avoided. One of them I will call 
"purism." This is the error of supposing that a given book can be read in only one way. 
It is an error because books are not pure in character, and that in turn is due to the fact 
that the human mind, which writes or reads them, is rooted in the senses and 
imagination and moves or is moved by emotions and sentiment. 
The second error I call "obscurantism." This is the error of supposing that all books can 
be read in only one way. Thus, there is the extreme of estheticism, which regards all 
books as if they were poetry, refusing to distinguish other types of literature and other 
modes of reading. The other extreme is that of intellectualism, which treats all books as 
if they were instructive, as if nothing could be found in a book except knowledge. Both 
errors are epitomized in a single line by Keats！"Beauty is truth, truth beauty"！which 
may contribute to the effect of his ode, but which is false as a principle of criticism or as 
a guide to reading books. 
You have been sufficiently warned now what to expect, and what not, from the rules 
which the following chapters will discuss in detail. You will not be able to misuse them 
very much, because you will find that they do not work outside their proper and limited 
field of applicability. The man who sells you a frying pan seldom tells you that you will 
not find it useful as a refrigerator. He knows you can be trusted to find that out for 
yourself. 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
Catching on From the Title 
 -1- 
just by their titles, you might not be able to tell in the case of Main Street and 
Middletown which was social science and which was fiction. Even after you had read 
them both you might still hesitate. There is so much social science in some 
contemporary novels, and so much fiction in most of sociology, that it is hard to keep 
them apart. (It was recently announced, for instance, that The Grapes of Wrath had been 
made required reading in the social-science courses of several colleges.) 

As I have already said, books can be read in several ways. One can understand why 
some literary critics review a novel by dos Passes or Steinbeck as if they were 
considering a scientific research or a piece of political oratory; or why some are tempted 
to read Freud's latest book, on Moses, as a romance. In many cases, the fault is with the 
book and author. 
Authors sometimes have mixed motives. Like other human beings, they are subject to 
the failing of wanting to do too many things at once. If they are confused in their 
intentions, the reader cannot be blamed for not knowing which pair of reading glasses to 
put on. The best rules of reading will not work on bad books！except, perhaps, to help 
you find out that they are bad. 
Let us put aside that large group of contemporary books which confuse science and 
fiction, or fiction and oratory. There are enough books！the great books of the past and 
many good contemporary books！which are perfectly deal in their intention and which, 
therefore, deserve a discriminating reading from us. The first rule of reading requires us 
to be discriminating. I should say the first rule of the first reading. It can be expressed as 
follows: you must know what kind of book you are reading, and you should know this 
as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to read. 
You must know, for instance, whether you are reading fiction！a novel, a play, an epic, 
or a lyric！or whether it is an expository work of some sort！a book which conveys 
knowledge primarily. Picture the confusion of a person who plodded through a novel, 
all the while supposing it to be a philosophical discourse; or of one who meditated on a 
scientific treatise as if it were a lyric. You cannot, because I have asked you to imagine 
what is almost impossible. For the most part, people know the kind of book they are 
reading before they start. They picked it out to read because it was of that kind. This is 
certainly true of the main distinction in types of books. People know whether they want 
amusement or instruction, and seldom go to the wrong counter for what they want. 
Unfortunately, there are other distinctions which are not so simple and so commonly 
recognized. Since we have temporarily excluded imaginative literature from 
consideration, our problem here has to do with subordinate distinctions within the field 
of expository books. It is not merely a question of knowing which books are primarily 
instructive, but which are instructive in a particular way. The kinds of information or 
enlightenment which a history and a philosophical book afford are not the same. The 
problems dealt with by a book on physics and one on morals are not the same, nor are 
the methods that the writers employ in solving such different problems. 
You cannot read books that differ thus, in the same way. I do not mean that the rules of 
reading are as radically different here as in the case of the basic distinction between 
poetry and science. All these books have much in common. They deal in knowledge. 
But they are also different, and to read them well we must read them in a manner 
appropriate to their differences. 
I must confess that at this point I feel like a salesman who, having just persuaded the 
customer that the price is not too high, cannot avoid mentioning the sales tax which is 
additional. The customer's ardor begins to wilt. The salesman overcomes this obstacle 
by some more smooth talk, and then is forced to say that he cannot make delivery for 
several weeks. If the buyer does not walk out on him at that point, he is lucky. Well, I 
have no sooner finished persuading you that certain distinctions are worth observing, 
than I have to add: "But there are still more." I hope you will not walk out on me. I 
promise you that there is an end to the making of distinctions in types of reading. The 
end is in this chapter. 

Let me repeat the rule again: you must know what kind of (expository) book you are 
reading, and you should know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before 
you begin to read. Everything is clear here except the last clause. How, you may ask, 
can the reader be expected to know what sort of book he is reading before he begins to 
read? 
May I remind you that a book always has a title and, more than that, it usually has a 
subtitle, a table of contents, a preface or introduction by the author? I shall neglect the 
publisher's blurb. After all, you may have to read a book which has lost its jacket. 
What is conventionally called the "front matter" is usually sufficient for the purpose of 
classification, anyway. The front matter consists of the title, subtitle, table of contents, 
and preface. These are the signals the author flies in your face to let you know which 
way the wind is blowing. It is not his fault if you will not stop, look, and listen. 
 - 2 - 
The number of readers who pay no attention to the signals is larger than you might 
suspect, unless you happen to be one of those who are honest enough to admit it. I have 
had this experience again and again with students. I have asked them what a book was 
about. I have asked them to tell me, in the most general terms, what sort of book it was. 
This, I have found, is a good way, almost an indispensable way, to begin a discussion. 
Many students are unable to answer this first and simplest question about the book. 
Sometimes they apologize by saying that they haven't finished reading it yet, and 
therefore do not know. That's no excuse, I point out. Did you look at the title? Did you 
study the table of contents? Did you read the preface or introduction? No, they did not. 
The front matter of a book seems to be like the ticking of a clock！ something you 
notice only when it is not there. 
One reason why titles and prefaces are ignored by so many readers is that they do not 
think it important to classify the book they are reading. They do not follow this first 
rule. If they tried to follow it, they would be grateful to the author for helping them. 
Obviously, the author thinks it is important for the reader to know the kind o♀ book he 
is being given. That is why he goes to the trouble of making it plain in the preface, and 
usually tries to make his title more or less descriptive. Thus, Einstein and Infeld, in their 
preface to The Evolution of Physics, tell the reader that they expect him to know "that a 
scientific book, even though popular, must not be read in the same way as a novel." 
They also construct, as many authors do, an analytical table of contents to advise the 
reader in advance of the details of their treatment. In any case, the chapter headings 
listed in the front serve the purpose of amplifying the significance of the main title. 
The reader who ignores all these things has only himself to blame if he is puzzled by the 
question: What kind of book is this? He is going to get more perplexed. If he cannot 
answer that question, and if he never asks it of himself, he is going to be unable to ask 
or answer a lot of other questions about the book. 
Recently Mr. Hutchins and I were reading two books together with a class of students. 
One was by Machiavelli, the other by Thomas Aquinas. In the opening discussion, Mr. 
Hutchins asked whether the two books were of the same kind. He happened to pick on a 
student who had not finished his reading of them. The student used that as an excuse to 
avoid answering. "But," said Mr. Hutchins, "how about their titles?" The student had 
failed to observe that Machiavelli had written about The Prince, and St. Thomas about 
The Governance of Princes. When the word "prince" was put on the board and 

underlined, the student was willing to guess that both books were about the same 
problem. 
''But what sort of problem is it?" Mr. Hutchins persisted. 
"What kind of books are these?" The student now thought he saw a lead, and reported 
that he had read the two prefaces. "How does that help?" Mr. Hutchins asked. "Well," 
said the student, "Machiavelli wrote his little guidebook on how to be a dictator and get 
away with it for Lorenzo de' Medici, and St. Thomas wrote his for the King of Cyprus." 
We did not stop at that point to correct the error in this statement. St. Thomas was not 
trying to help tyrants get away with it. The student had used one word, however, which 
almost answered the question. When asked which word it was, he did not know. When 
told that it was "guidebook," he did not realize the significance of what he had said. I 
asked him if he knew in general what sort of book a guidebook was? Was a cookbook a 
guidebook? Was a moral treatise a guidebook? Was a book on the art of writing poetry a 
guidebook? He answered all these questions affirmatively. 
We reminded him of a distinction that had been made in class before between 
theoretical and practical books. "Oh," he said, with a burst of light, "these are both 
practical books, books which tell you what should be done rather than what is the case." 
At the end of another halt-hour, with other students drawn into the discussion, we 
finally managed to get the two books classified as practical works in politics. The rest 
of the period was spent in trying to find out whether the two authors understood politics 
in the same way, and whether their books were equally practical or practical in the same 
way. 
I report this story not merely to corroborate my statement about the general neglect of 
titles, but to make a further point. The clearest titles in the world, the most explicit front 
matter, will not help you classify a book, even if you pay attention to these signs, unless 
you have the broad lines of classification already in mind. 
You will not know the sense in which Euclid's Elements of Geometry and William 
James's Principles of Psychology are books of the same sort if you do not know that 
psychology and geometry are both theoretic sciences; nor will you further be able to 
distinguish them as different unless you know that there are different kinds of science. 
Similarly, in the case of Aristotle's Politics and Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, 
you can tell how these books are alike and different only if you know what a practical 
problem is, and what different kinds of practical problems are. 
Titles sometimes make the grouping of books easy. Anyone would know that Euclid's 
Elements, Descartes' Geometry, and IIilbert's Foundations of Geometry were three 
mathematical books, more or less closely related in subject matter. This is not always 
the case. It might not be so easy to tell from the titles that St. Augustine's City of God, 
Hobbes' Leviathan, and Rousseau's Social Contract were political treatises, although a 
careful perusal of their chapter headings would reveal the problem common to these 
three books. 
To group books as being of the same kind is not enough, however. To follow this first 
rule of reading you must know what that kind is. The title will not tell you, nor all the 
rest of the front matter, nor even the whole book itselt sometimes, unless you have some 
categories you can apply to classify books intelligently. In other words, this rule has to 
be made a little more intelligible for you if you are to follow it intelligently. This can be 
done only by a brief discussion of the main kinds of expository books. 

Perhaps you read the weekly literary supplements. They classify the books received that 
week under a series of headings, such as: fiction and poetry, or belles-lettres; history 
and biography; philosophy and religion; science and psychology; economics and social 
science; and there is usually a long listing under "miscellaneous." These categories are 
all right as rough approximations, but they fail to make some basic distinctions and they 
associate some books which should be separated. 
They are not as bad as a sign I have seen in certain bookstores, which indicates the 
shelves where there are books on "philosophy, theosophy, and new thought." They are 
not as good as the standard library scheme of classification, which is more detailed, but 
even that is not quite right for our purposes. We need a scheme of classification which 
groups books with an eye to the problems of reading, and not for the purpose of selling 
them or putting them on shelves. 
I am going to propose, first, one major distinction, and then, several further distinctions 
subordinate to the major one. I will not bother you with distinctions which do not matter 
so far as your skill in reading is concerned. 
 - 3 - 
The major distinction is between theoretical and practical boN^s. Everyone uses the 
words "theoretical" and "practical," but few know what they mean, least of all the hard 
headed practical man who distrusts all theorists, especially it they are in the 
government. For many, "theoretical" means visionary or even mystical, and "practical" 
means something that works, something that has an immediate cash return. There is an 
element of truth in this. The practical has to do with what works in some way, at once or 
in the long run. The theoretical concerns something to be seen or understood. If we 
polish the rough truth that is here grasped, we come to the distinction between 
knowledge and action as the two ends a writer may have in mind. 
But, you may say, are we not dealing here with books which convey knowledge? How 
can action come in? You forget that intelligent action depends on knowledge. 
Knowledge can be used in many ways, not only for controlling nature and inventing 
useful machines but also for directing human conduct and regulating man's operations 
in various fields of skill. What I have in mind here is exemplified by the distinction 
between pure and applied science, or, as it is sometimes inaccurately phrased, science 
and technology. 
Some books and some teachers are interested only in the knowledge itself which they 
have to communicate. This does not mean that they deny its utility, or that they insist 
knowledge is good only for its own sake. They simply limit themselves to one kind of 
teaching, and leave the othel kind to other men. These others have an interest beyond 
knowledge for its own sake. They are concerned with the problems of human life which 
knowledge can be used to solve. They communicate knowledge, too, but always with an 
emphasis upon its application. 
To make knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of operation. We must pass 
from knowing what is the case to knowing what to do about it if we wish to get 
somewhere. I can summarize this by reminding you of a distinction you have already 
met in this book, between knowing that and knowing how. Theoretic books teach you 
that something is the case. Practical books teach you how to do something which you 
think you should. 

This book is practical, not theoretic. Any "guidebook," to use the student's phrase, is a 
practical book. Any book which tells you either what you should do or how to do it is 
practical. Thus you see that the class of practical books includes all expositions of arts 
to be learned, all manuals of practice in any field, such as engineering or medicine or 
cooking, and treatises which are conventionally classified as morals, such as books on 
economic, ethical, or political problems. 
One other instance of practical writing should be mentioned. An oration！a political 
speech or a moral exhortation！certainly tries to tell you what you should do or how 
you should feel about something. Anyone who writes practically about anything not 
only tries to advise you but also tries to get you to follow his advice. Hence there is an 
element of oratory in every moral treatise. It is also present in books which try to teach 
an art, such as this one. I, for example, have tried to persuade you to make the effort to 
learn to read. 
Although every practical book is somewhat oratorical！or perhaps, as we would say 
today, goes in for propaganda！it does not follow that oratory is coextensive with the 
practical. You know the difference between a political harangue and a treatise on 
politics, or economic propaganda and an analysis of economic problems. The 
Communist Manifesto is a piece of oratory, but Das Kapital is much more than that. 
Sometimes you can detect that a book is practical by ita title. If it contains such phrases 
as "the art of" or "how to," you can spot it at once. If the title names fields which you 
know are practical, such as economics or politics, engineering or business, law or 
medicine, you can classify the books readily. 
There are still other signs. I once asked a student if he could tell from the titles which of 
two books by John Locke was practical and which was theoretical. The two titles were: 
An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and An Essay Concerning the Origin, 
Extent and End of Civil Government, The student had caught on from the titles. He said 
that the problems of government were practical, and that the analysis of understanding 
was theoretical. 
He went further. He said he had read Locke's introduction to the book on understanding. 
There Locke expressed his design as being to inquire into the "origin, certainty, and 
extent of human knowledge." The phrasing resembled the title of the book on 
government, with one important difference. Locke was concerned with the certainty or 
validity of knowledge in the one case, and with the end of government in the other. 
Now, said the student, questions about the validity of something are theoretic, whereas 
to raise questions about the end of anything, the purpose it serves, is practical. 
That student had several ways of catching on to the kind of book he was reading and, I 
may add, he was a better reader than most. Let me use his example to offer you a piece 
of general advice. Make your first effort to diagnose a book from its title and the rest of 
the front matter. If that is insufficient, you will have to depend on signs to be found in 
the main body of the text. By paying attention to the words and keeping the basic 
categories in mind, you should be able to classify a book without reading very far. 
A practical book will soon betray its character by the frequent occurrence of such words 
as "should" and "ought," "good" and "bad," "ends" and "means." The characteristic 
statement in a practical book is one that says that something should be done; or that this 
is the right way of doing something; or that one thing is better than another as an end to 
be sought, or a means to be chosen. In contrast, a theoretical book keeps saying "is," not 
"should" or "ought." It tries to show that something is true, that these are the facts; not 

that things would be better if they were otherwise, and this is the way to make them 
better. 
Before turning now to the subdivision of theoretical books, let me caution you against 
supposing that the problem is as simple as telling whether you are drinking tea or 
coffee. I have merely suggested some signs whereby you can begin to make these 
discriminations. The better you understand everything that is involved in the distinction 
between the theoretical and the practical, the better you will be able to use the signs. 
You will learn to mistrust names and, of course, titles. ^uu will find that although 
economics is primarily and usually a practical matter, there are, nevertheless, books on 
economics which are purely theoretical. You will find authors who do not know the 
difference between theory and practice, just as there are novelists who do not know the 
difference between fiction and sociology. You will find books that seem to be partly of 
one sort and partly of an-1 other, such as Spinoza's Ethics. It remains, nevertheless, to ; 
your advantage as a reader to detect the way the author approaches his problem. For this 
purpose the distinction between theoretical and practical is primary. 
 - 4 - 
You are already familiar with the subdivision of theo-.retica] books into history, 
science, and philosophy. Everybody, except the professors of those subjects, knows the 
differences here in a rough way. It is only when you try to refine the obvious, and give 
the distinctions great precision, that you get into difficulties. Since I do not want you to 
get as confused as the professors, I shall not try to define what history is, or science and 
philosophy. Rough approximation will suffice for us to be able to distinguish the 
theoretic books we read as being of one sort or another. 
In the case of history, the title usually does the trick. If the word "history" does not 
appear in the title, the rest of the front matter informs us that this is a book about 
something which happened in the past, not necessarily in antiquity, for it may have been 
only yesterday. You remember the schoolboy who characterized the study of arithmetic 
by the oft-repeated question: "What goes into?" History can be similarly characterized 
by: "What happened next?" History is knowledge of particular events or things which 
not only existed in the past but underwent a series of changes in the course of time. The 
historian narrates these happenings and often colors his narrative with some comment 
on, or insight into, the significance of the events. 
Science is not concerned with the past as such. It treats of matters that can happen at any 
time or place. Everyone knows that the scientist seeks laws or generalizations. He wants 
to find out how things happen for the most part or in every case, not, as the historian, 
how some particular things happened at a given time and place in the past. 
The title enables us to tell whether a book offers us instruction in science less frequently 
than it does in the case of history. The word "science" sometimes appears, but more 
usually the name of the subject matter occurs, such as psychology or geology or 
physics. Then we must know whether that subject matter belongs to the scientist, as 
geology clearly does, or to the philosopher, as metaphysics clearly does. The trouble is 
with the cases that are not so clear, such as physics and psychology which have been 
claimed, at various times, by both scientists and philosophers. There is even trouble 
with the words "philosophy" and "science" themselves, for they have been variously 
used. Aristotle called his book on Physics a scientific treatise, though according to 
current usage we should regard it as philosophical; and Newton entitled his great work 

Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, though it is tor us one of the 
masterpieces of science. 
Philosophy is like science and differs from history in that it seeks general truths rather 
than an account of particular past events. But the philosopher does not ask the same sort 
of questions as the scientist, nor does he employ the same kind of method to answer 
them. 
If you are interested in pursuing the matter further, I am going to recommend that you 
try to read Jacques Maritain's Degrees of Knowledge which offers a sound grasp of the 
method and aim of modern science, as well as a rich apprehension of the scope and 
nature of philosophy. Only a contemporary writer can treat of this distinction 
adequately, because it is only in the last hundred years or so that we have fully 
appreciated what is involved in the problem of distinguishing and relating philosophy 
and science. And among contemporary writers, Jacques Maritain is rare in being able to 
do justice to both science and philosophy. 
Since titles and subject-matter names are not likely to help us discriminate whether a 
book is philosophical or scientific, how can we tell? I have one criterion to offer that I 
think will always work, although you may have to read a great deal of the book before 
you can apply it. If a theoretic book refers to things which lie outside the scope of your 
normal, routine, daily experience, it is a scientific work. If not, it is philosophical. 
Let me illustrate. Galileo's Two New Sciences requires you to imagine, or to see for 
yourself in a laboratory, the experiment of the inclined plane. Newton's Opticks refers to 
experiences in dark rooms with prisms, mirrors, and specially controlled rays of light. 
The special experience to which the author refers may not have been obtained by him in 
a laboratory. You, too, may have to travel far and wide to get that sort of experience. 
The facts which Darwin reports in The Origin of Species, he observed in the course of 
many years of fieldwork; yet they are facts which can be and have been rechecked by 
other observers making a similar effort. They are not facts which can be checked in 
terms of the ordinary daily experience of the average man. 
In contrast, a philosophical book appeals to no facts or observations which lie outside 
the experience of the ordinary man. A philosopher refers the reader to his own normal 
and common experience for the verification or support of anything he has to say. Thus, 
Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding is a philosophical work in 
psychology, whereas Freud's writings are scientific. Locke makes every point in terms 
of the experience you have of your own mental processes. Freud can make most of his 
points only by reporting to you what he observed under the clinical conditions of the 
psychoanalyst's office！things that most people never dream of, or, if they do, not as the 
psycho-analyst sees them. 
The distinction I have suggested is popularly recognized when we say that science is 
experimental or depends upon elaborate observational researches, whereas philosophy is 
really armchair thinking. The contrast is not intended invidiously. There are some 
problems which can be solved in an armchair by a man who knows how to think about 
them in the light of common, human experience. There are other problems, of course, 
that no amount of the best armchair thinking can solve. What is needed is investigation 
of some sort！experiments or research in the field！to extend experience beyond the 
normal, everyday routine. Special experience is required. 
I do not mean that the philosopher is a pure thinker and that the scientist is merely an 
observer. Both have to observe and think, but they think about different sorts of 

observation. One has' to make the observations specially, under special conditions, and 
so forth, before he can think to solve the problem. The other can rely upon his ordinary 
experience. 
This difference in method always reveals itself in philosophical and scientific books, 
and that is how you can tell which sort of book you are reading. If you note the sort of 
experience that is being referred to as a condition of understanding what is being said, 
you will know whether the book is scientific ot philosophical. The rules of extrinsic 
reading are more complicated in the case of scientific books. You may actually have to 
witness an experiment or go to a museum, unless you can use your imagination to 
construct something you have never observed, which the author is describing as the 
basis for his most important statements. 
Not only are the extrinsic conditions for reading scientific and philosophical books 
different, but so also are the rules of intrinsic reading subject to different application in 
the two cases. Scientists and philosophers do not think in exactly the same way. Their 
styles in arguing are different. You must be able to find the terms and propositions 
which constitute these different sorts of argumentation. That is why it is important to 
know the kind of book you are reading. 
T'he same is true of history. Historical statements are different from scientific and 
philosophical ones. An historian argues differently and interprets facts differently. 
Furthermore, most history books are narrative in form. And a narrative is a narrative, 
whether it be fact or fiction. The historian must write poetically, by which I mean he 
must obey the rules for telling a good story. The intrinsic rules for reading a history are, 
therefore, more complicated than for science and philosophy, because you must 
combine the kind of reading that is appropriate to expository books with the kind proper 
for poetry or fiction. 
 - 5 - 
We have discovered one interesting thing in the course of this discussion. History 
presents complications for intrinsic reading, because it curiously combines two types of 
writing. Science presents complications in the way of extrinsic reading, because it 
requires the reader somehow to follow the report of special experiences. I do not mean 
that these are the only complications in either intrinsic or extrinsic reading. We shall 
find others later. But so far as the two mentioned are concerned, philosophy would 
appear to be the simplest type of reading. It is so only in the sense that a mastery of the 
rules tor reading expository works is by itself most conducive to mastering 
philosophical books. 
You may object to all this making of distinctions upon distinctions as of little moment 
for one who wants to learn to read. I think I can meet your objections here, though it 
may take more than I can say now to convince you fully. In the first place, let me 
remind you that you have already acknowledged the reason for distinguishing between 
poetry and science. You realized that one cannot read fiction and geometry in the same 
way. The same rules will not work for both sorts of books, nor will they work in the 
same way for different kinds of instructive books, such as histories and philosophies. 
In the second place, let me call your attention to an obvious fact. If you walked into a 
classroom in which a teacher was lecturing or otherwise instructing students, you could 
tell very soon, I think, whether the class was one in history, science, or philosophy. 
There would be something in the way the teacher proceeded, the kind of words he used. 
the type of arguments he employed, the sort of problems he proposed, which would give 

him away as belonging to one department or another. And it would make a difference to 
you to know this, if you were going to try to listen intelligently to what went on. 
Fortunately, most of us are not aJ dull as the boy who sat through half a semester of 
philosophy without knowing that the history course for which he had registered met 
elsewhere. 
In short, the methods of teaching different kinds of subject matter are different. Any 
teacher knows this. Because of the difference in method and subject matter, the 
philosopher usually finds it easier to teach students who have not been previously taught 
by his colleagues, whereas the scientist prefers the student whom his colleagues have 
already prepared. Philosophers generally find it harder to teach one another than 
scientists do. I mention these well-known facts to indicate what I mean by the inevitable 
difference in teaching philosophy and science. 
Now, if there is a difference in the art of teaching in different fields, there must be a 
reciprocal difference in the art of being taught. The activity of the student must 
somehow be responsive to the activity of the instructor. The relation between books and 
their readers is the same as that between living teachers and their students. H&nce, as 
books differ in the kinds of knowledge they have to communicate, they proceed to 
instruct us differently; and, if we are to follow them, we must leam to read each kind in 
an appropriate-manner. 
Having taken all the trouble of this chapter to make the point, I am now going to let you 
down. Or, perhaps, you will be relieved to learn that in the following chapters, which 
discuss the remaining rules of reading, I am going to treat all books which convey 
knowledge, and which we read for information and enlightenment, as it they were of the 
same sort. They are of the same sort in the most general way. They are all expository 
rather than poetic. And it is necessary to introduce you to these rules in the most general 
way first, before qualifying them for application to the subordinate kinds of expository 
literature. 
The qualifications will be intelligible only after you have grasped the rules in general. I 
shall try, therefore, to postpone any further discussion of subordinate kinds undl Chapter 
Fourteen. By that time you will have surveyed all the rules of reading and understood 
something of their application to any sort of book conveying knowledge. Then it will be 
possible to suggest how the distinctions we have made in this chapter call for 
qualifications in the rules. 
When you are all done, you may see better than you do now why the first rule of the 
first reading of any book is to know what kind of book it is. I hope you do, because I am 
sure thai the expert reader is a man of many fine discriminations. 
 
 CHAPTER NINE 
Seeing the Skeleton 
 -1- 
every book has a skeleton hidden between its boards. Your job is to find it. A book 
comes to you with flesh on its bare bones and clothes over its flesh. It is all dressed up. I 
am not asking you to be impolite or cruel. You do not have to undress it or tear the flesh 
off its limbs to get at the firm structure that underlies the soft. But you must read the 

book with X-ray eyes, for it is an essential part of your first apprehension of any book to 
grasp its structure. 
You know how violently some people are opposed to vivisection. There are others who 
feel as strongly against analysis of any sort. They simply do not like to have things 
taken apart, even if the only instrument used in cutting up is the mind. They somehow 
feel that something is being destroyed by analysis. This is particularly true in the case of 
works of art. If you try to show them the inner structure, the articulation of the parts, the 
way the joints fit together, they react as if you had murdered the poem or the piece of 
music. 
That is why I have used the metaphor of the X ray. No harm is done to the living 
organism by having its skeleton lighted up. The patient does not even feel as if his 
privacy had been infringed upon. Yet the doctor has discovered the disposition of the 
parts. He has a visible map of the total layout. He has an architect's ground plan. No one 
doubts the usefulness of such knowledge to help further operations on the living 
organism. 
Well, in the same way, you can penetrate beneath the moving surface of a book to its 
rigid skeleton. You can see the way the parts are articulated, how they hang together, 
and the thread that ties them into a whole. You can do this without impairing in the least 
the vitality of the book you are reading. You need not fear that Humpty-Dumpty will be 
all in pieces, never to come together again. The whole can'remain in animation while 
you proceed to find out what makes the wheels go round. 
I had one experience as a student which taught me this lesson. Like other boys of the 
same age, I thought I could write lyric poetry. I may have even thought I was a poet. 
Perhaps that is why I reacted so strongly against a teacher of English literature who 
insisted that we be able to state the unity of every poem in a single sentence and then 
give a prosaic catalogue of its contents by an orderly enumeration of all its subordinate 
parts. 
To do this with Shelley's Adonais or with an ode by Keats seemed to me nothing short 
of rape and mayhem. When you got finished with such cold-blooded butchery, all the 
"poetry" would be gone. But I did the work I was asked to do and, after a year of 
analysis, I found otherwise. A poem was not destroyed by such tactics in reading. On 
the contrary, the greater insight which resulted seemed to make the poem more like a 
vital organism. Instead of its being an ineffable blur, it moved before one with the grace 
and proportion of a living thing. 
That was my first lesson in reading. From it I learned two rules, which are the second 
and third rules for the first reading of any book. I say "any book." These rules apply to 
science as well as poetry, and to any sort of expository work. Their application will be 
somewhat different, of course, according to the kind of book they are used on. The unity 
of a novel is not the same as the unity of a treatise on politics; nor are the parts of the 
same sort, or ordered in the same way. But every book which is worth reading at all has 
a unity and an organization of parts. A book which did not would be a mess. It would be 
relatively unreadable, as bad books actually are. 
 - 2 C 
I am going to state these two rules as simply as possible. Then I shall explain them and 
illustrate them. (The first rule, which we discussed in the last chapter, was: Classify the 
book according to kind and subject matter.) 

The second rule！1 say "second" because I want to keep the numbering of the four rules 
which comprise the first Way of reading！can be expressed as follows: State the unity 
of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most in several sentences (a short 
paragraph). 
This means that you must be able to say what the whole book is about as briefly as 
possible. To say what the whole book is about is not the same as saying what kind of 
book it is. The word "about" maybe misleading here. In one sense, a book is about a 
certain type of subject matter, which it treats in a certain way. If you know this, you 
know what kind of book it is. But there is another and perhaps more colloquial sense of 
"about." We ask a person what he is about, what he is up to. So we can wonder what an 
author is trying to do. To find out what a book is about in this sense is to discover its 
theme or main point. 
Everyone, I think, will admit that a book is a work of art. Furthermore, they will agree 
that in proportion as it is good, as a book and as a work of art, it has a more perfect and 
pervasive unity. They know this to be true of music and paintings, novels and plays. It is 
no less true of books which convey knowledge. But it is not enough to acknowledge this 
fact vaguely. You must apprehend the unity with definiteness. There is only one way 
that I know of being sure you have succeeded. You must be able to tell yourself or 
anybody else what the unity is and in a few words. Do not be satisfied with "feeling the 
unity" which you cannot express. The student who says, "I know what it is, but I just 
can't say it," fools no one, not even himself. 
The third rule can be expressed as follows: Set forth the major parts of the book, and 
show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the 
unity of the whole. 
The reason for this rule should be obvious. If a work of art were absolutely simple, it 
would, of course, have no parts. But that is not the case. None of the sensible, physical 
things man knows is simple in this absolute way, nor is any human production. They are 
all complex unities. You have not grasped a complex unity if all you know about it. is 
how it is one. You must also know how it is many, not a many which consists of a lot of 
separate things, but an .organized many. If the parts were not organically related, the 
whole which they composed would not be one. Strictly speaking, there would be no 
whole at all but merely a collection. 
You know the difference between a heap of bricks, on the one hand, and the single 
house they can constitute, on the other. You know the difference between one house and 
a collection of houses. A book is like a single house. It is a mansion of many rooms, 
rooms on different levels, of different sizes and shapes, with different outlooks, rooms 
with different functions to perform. These rooms are independent, in part. Each has its 
own structure and interior decoration. But they are not absolutely independent and 
separate. They are connected by doors and arches, by corridors and stairways. Because 
they are connected, the partial function which each performs contributes its share to the 
usefulness of the whole house. Otherwise the house would not be genuinely livable. 
The architectural analogy is almost perfect. A good book, like a good house, is an 
orderly arrangement of parts. Each major part has a certain amount of independence. As 
we shall see, it may have an interior structure of its own. But it must also be connected 
with the other parts！that is, related to them functionally！for otherwise it could not 
contribute its share to the intelligibility of the whole. 

As houses are more or less livable, so books are more or less readable. The most 
readable book is an architectural achievement on the part of the author. The best books 
are those that have the most intelligible structure and, I might add, the most apparent. 
Though they are usually more complex than poorer books, their greater complexity is 
somehow also a great simplicity, because their parts are better organized, more unified. 
That is one of the reasons why the great books are most readable. Lesser works are 
really more bothersome to read. Yet to read them well！that is, as well as they can be 
read！you must try to find some plan in them. They would have been better if the 
author had himself seen the plan a little more clearly. But if they hang together at all, if 
they are a complex unity to any degree, there must be a plan and you must find it. 
 - 3 C 
Let me return now to the second rule which requires you to state the unity. A few 
illustrations of this rule in operation may guide you in putting it into practice. I begin 
with a famous case. Many of you probably read Homer's Odyssey in school. Certainly 
most of you know the story of Ulysses, the man who took ten years to return from the 
siege of Troy only to find his faithful wife Penelope herself besieged by suitors. It is an 
elaborate story as Homer tells it, full of exciting adventures on land and sea, replete 
with episodes of all sorts and many complications of plot. Being a good story, it has a 
single unity of action, a main thread of plot which ties everything together. 
Aristotle, in his Poetics insists that this is the mark of every good story, novel, or play. 
To support his point, he shows you how the unity of the Odyssey can be summarized in 
a few sentences. 
A certain man is absent from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Neptune, 
and left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plight; suitors are wasting his 
substance and plotting against his son. At length, tempest-tost, he himself arrives; he 
makes certain persons acquainted with him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand, 
and is himself preserved while he destroys them. 
"This," says Aristotle, "is the essence of the plot; the rest is episode." 
After you know the plot in this way, and through it the unity of the whole narrative, you 
can put the parts into their proper places. You might find it a good exercise to try this 
with some novels you have read. Try it on some great ones. such as Tom Jones or Crime 
and Punishment or the modern Ulysses. Once when Mr. Clifton Fadiman was visiting 
Chicago, Mr. Hutchins and I asked him to lead our class in the discussion of Fielding's 
Tom Jones. He reduced the plot to the familiar formula: boy meets girl, boy wants girl, 
boy gets girl. This is the plot of every romance. The class learned what it means to say 
that there are only a small number of plots in the world. The difference between good 
and bad fiction having the same essential plot lies in what the author does with it, how 
he dresses up the bare bones. 
For another illustration！a more appropriate one because it deals with nonfiction！let 
us take the first six chapters of this book. You have read them once by this time, I hope. 
Treating them as if they were a complete whole, can you state their unity? If I were 
asked to, I would do it in the following manner. This book is about the nature of reading 
in general, the various kinds of reading, and the relation of the art of reading to the art of 
being taught in school and out. It considers, therefore, the serious consequences of the 
neglect of reading in contemporary education, suggesting as a solution that books can be 
substituted for living teachers if individuals can help themselves learn how to read. 

There is the unityas I see it in two sentences. I hesitate to ask you to reread the first six 
chapters to see whether I am right. 
Sometimes an author obligingly tells you on the title page what the unity is. In the 
eighteenth century, writers had the habit of composing elaborate titles which told the 
reader what the whole book was about. Here is a title by Jeremy Collier, an English 
divine who attacked the obscenity of the Restoration drama much more learnedly than 
the Legion of Decency has recently attacked the movies: A Short View of the Immorality 
and Profaneness of the English Stage, together with the Sense of Antiquity upon this 
Argument. You know from this that Collier recites many flagrant instances of the abuse 
of public morals and that he is going to support his protest by quoting texts from those 
ancients who argued, as Plato did, that the stage corrupts youth, or, as the early Church 
fathers did, that plays are seductions of the flesh and the devil. 
Sometimes the author tells you the unity of his plan in his preface. In this respect, 
expository books differ radically from fiction. A scientific or philosophical writer has 
no reason to keep you in suspense. In fact, the less suspense such an author keeps you 
in, the more likely you are to sustain the effort of reading him through. Like a 
newspaper story, an expository book may summarize itself in its first paragraph. 
Do not be too proud to accept the author's help if he proffers it, but do not rely too 
completely on what he says in the preface. The best-laid plans of authors, like those of 
other mice and men, gang aft agley. Be somewhat guided by the prospectus the author 
gives you, but always remember that the obligation of finding the unity belongs to the 
reader, as much as having one belongs to the writer. You can discharge that obligation 
honestly only by reading the whole book. 
The opening paragraph of Herodotus' history of the war between the Greeks and the 
Persians provides an excellent summary of the whole. It runs: These are the researches 
of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, in order that the actions of men may not be effaced by 
time, nor the great and wondrous deeds displayed by Greeks and barbarians be deprived 
of renown; and for the rest, for what cause they waged war upon one another. That is a 
good beginning for you as a reader. It tells you succinctly what the whole book is about. 
But you had better not stop there. After you have read the nine parts through, you will 
probably find it necessary to elaborate on that statement to do justice to the whole. You 
may want to mention the Persian kings！Cyrus, Darius, and Xerxes！the Greek heroes 
of Salamis and Thermopylae, and the major events！the crossing of the Hellespont and 
the decisive battles of the war. 
All the rest of the fascinating details, with which Herodotus richly prepares you for his 
climax, can be left out of the plot. Note, here, that the unity of a history is a single 
thread of plot, very much as in fiction. That is part of what I meant in the last chapter by 
saying that history is an amalgam of science and poetry. So far as unity is concerned, 
this rule of reading elicits the same kind of answer in history and fiction. But there are 
other rules of reading which require the same kind of analysis in history as in science 
and philosophy. 
A few more illustrations should suffice. I shall do a practical book first. Aristotle's 
Ethics is an inquiry into the nature of human happiness and an analysis of the conditions 
under which happiness may be gained or lost, with an indication of what men must do 
in their conduct and thinking in order to become happy or to avoid unhappiness, the 
principal emphasis being placed on the cultivation of the virtues, moral and intellectual, 

although other necessary goods are also recognized, such as wealth, health, friends, and 
a just society in which to live. 
Another practical book is Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. Here the reader is aided by 
the author's own statement of "the plan of the work" at the very beginning. But that 
takes several pages. The unity can be more briefly stated as follows: this is an inquiry 
into the sources of national wealth in any economy which is built on a division of labor, 
considering the relation of the wages paid labor, the profits returned to capital, and the 
rent owed the landowner, as the prime factors in the price of commodities. It discusses 
the various ways in which capital can be more or less gainfully employed, and relates 
the origin and use of money to the accumulation and employment of capital. Examining 
the development of opulence in different nations and under different conditions, it 
compares the several systems of political economy, and argues for the beneficence of 
free trade. If a reader grasped the unity of The Wealth of Nations in this way, and did a 
similar job tor Karl Marx's Das Kapital, he would be well on the way toward seeing the 
relation between two of the most influential books in modern times. 
Darwin's Origin of Species will provide us with a good example of the unity of a 
theoretic book in science. I would state it thus: this is an account of the variation of 
living things during the course of countless generations and the way in which it results 
in new groupings of plants and animals; it treats both of the variability of domesticated 
animals and of variability under natural conditions, showing how such factors as the 
struggle for existence and natural selection operate to bring about and sustain such 
groupings; it argues that species are not fixed and immutable groups, but that they are 
merely varieties in transition from a less to a more marked and permanent status, 
supporting this argument by evidences from extinct animals found in the earth's crust, 
from the geographical distribution of living things, and from comparative embryology 
and anatomy. That may seem like a big mouthful to you, but the book was an even 
bigger one for the nineteenth century to swallow in many gulps. 
Finally, I shall take Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding as a theoretic 
book in philosophy. You may recall from the last chapter that Locke himself 
summarized his work by saying that it was "an inquiry into the origin, certainty and 
extent of human knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion 
and assent." I would not quarrel with so excellent a statement of plan by the author, 
except to add two subordinate qualifications to do justice to the first and third parts of 
the essay: it will be shown, I would say, that there are no innate ideas but that all human 
knowledge is acquired from experience; and language will be discussed as a medium for 
the expression of thought, its proper uses and most familiar abuses to be indicated. 
There are two things I want you to note before we proceed. The first is how frequently 
you can expect the author, especially a good one, to help you state the plan of his book. 
Despite that fact, most students are almost at a total loss when you ask them to say 
briefly what the whole book is about. Partly that may be due to their general inability to 
speak concise English sentences. Partly it may be due to their neglect of this rule in 
reading. But it certainly indicates that they pay as little attention to the author's 
introductory words as they do to his title. I do not think it rash to conclude that what is 
true of students in school is true also of most readers in any walk of life. Readers of this 
sort, if they can be called readers at all, seem to want to keep a book as, according to 
William James, the world appears to a baby: a big, buzzing, blooming confusion. 
The second point is a plea that I make in self-defense. Please do not take the sample 
summaries I have given you as if I meant them, in each case, to be a final and absolute 
formulation of the book's unity. A unity can be variously stated. There is no simple 

criterion of right and wrong in this business. One statement is better than another, of 
course, in proportion as it is brief, accurate, and comprehensive. But quite different 
statements may be equally good, or equally bad. 
I have often stated the unity of a book quite differently from the author's expression of 
it, and without apologies to him. You may differ similarly from me. After all, a book is 
something different to each reader. It would not be surprising if that difference 
expressed itself in the way the reader stated its unity. This does not mean that anything 
goes. Though readers be different, the book is the same, and there can be an objective 
check upon the accuracy and fidelity of the statements anyone makes about it. 
 - 4 - 
Now we can turn to the other structural rule, the rule which requires us to set forth the 
major parts of the book in their order and relation. This third rule is closely related to 
the second which we have just discussed. You may have noticed already how a well-
stated unity indicates the major parts that compose the whole. You cannot apprehend a 
whole without somehow seeing its parts. But it is also true that unless you grasp the 
organization of its parts, you cannot know the whole comprehensively. 
You may wonder, therefore, why I have made two rules here instead of one. It is 
primarily a matter of convenience. It is easier to grasp a complex and unified structure 
in two steps rather than in one. The second rule directs your attention toward the unity, 
and the third toward the complexity, of a book. There is another reason for the 
separation. The major parts of a book may be seen at the moment when you grasp its 
unity. But these parts are usually themselves complex and have an interior structure you 
must see. Hence the third rule involves more than just an enumeration of the parts. It 
means treating the parts as if they were subordinate wholes, each with a unity and a 
complexity of its own. 
I can write out the formula for operating according to this third rule. Because it is a 
formula, it may guide you in a general way. According to the second rule, you will 
remember, we had to say: the whole book is about so and so and such and such. That 
done, we can proceed as follows: (1) the author accomplished this plan in five major 
parts, of which the first part is about so and so, the second part is about such and such, 
the third part is about this, the fourth' part about that, and the fifth about still another 
thing. (2) The first of these major parts is divided into three sections, of which the first 
considers X, the second considers Y, and the third considers Z. Each of the other major 
parts is then similarly divided. (3) In the first section of the first part, the author makes 
four points, of which the first is A, the second B, the third C, and the fourth D. Each of 
the other sections is then similarly analyzed, and this is done for each of the sections of 
each of the other major parts. 
Terrifying? I can see why it might be. All this to do, you say, and on what is only the 
first reading of a book. It woulc take a lifetime to read a book that way. If you feel this 
way, I can also see that all my warnings have done no good. When put down this way in 
a cold and exacting formula, the rule looks as if it required an impossible amount of 
work from you. But you have forgotten that the good reader does this sort of thing 
habitually, and hence easily and naturally. He may not write it all out. He may not even 
at the time of reading have made it all verbally explicit. But if he were called upon to 
give an account of the structure of a book, he would do something that approximated the 
formula I have suggested. 

The word "approximation" should relieve your anxiety.' A good rule always describes 
the ideal performance. But a man can be skilled in an art without being the ideal artist. 
He can be a good practitioner it he merely approximates the rule. I have stated the rule 
here for the ideal case. I would be satisfied, and so should you be with yourself, if you 
made a very rough approximation to what is required. Even when you become more 
skilled, you will not wish to read every book with the same degree of effort. You will 
not find it profitable to expend all your skill on some books. 
I have tried to make a close approximation to the requirements of this rule in the case of 
relatively few books. In other instances, which means for the most part, I am satisfied if 
I have a fairly rough notion of the book's structure. You will find, as I have, that the 
degree of approximation you wish to make varies with the character of the book and 
your purpose in reading it. Regardless of this variability, the rule remains the same. You 
must know how to follow it, whether you follow it closely and strictly or only in a 
rough fashion. 
The forbidding aspect of the formula for setting forth the order and relation of the parts 
may be somewhat lessened by a few illustrations of the rule in operation. Unfortunately, 
it is more difficult to illustrate this rule than the other one about stating the unity. A 
unity, after all, can be stated in a sentence or two, at most a short paragraph. But in the 
case of any large and complex book, a careful and adequate recital of the parts, and their 
parts, and their parts down to the least structural units, would take a great many pages to 
write out. 
Some of the greatest medieval commentaries on the works of Aristotle are longer than 
the originals. They include, of course, more than a structural analysis, for they 
undertake to interpret the author sentence by sentence. The same is true of certain 
modern commentaries, such as the great ones on Kant's The Critique of Pure Reason. I 
suggest that you look into a commentary of this sort if you want to see this rule 
followed to perfection. Aquinas, for instance, begins each section of his commentary 
with a beautiful outline of the points that Aristotle has made in that part of his work; and 
he always says explicitly how that part fits into the structure of the whole, especially in 
relation to the parts that come before and after. 
On second thought, perhaps you had better not look at masterly commentaries. A 
beginner in reading might be depressed by their perfection. He might feel as the 
beginner in climbing feels at the bottom of the Jungfrau. A poor and slight sample of 
analysis by me might be more encouraging, though certainly less uplifting. It is all right 
to hitch your wagon to a star, but you had better be sure it is well lubricated before you 
take the reins. 
 - 5 - 
There is one other difficulty about illustrating this rule. I must choose something that I 
can be relatively sure most of you have read. Otherwise you will not be able to profit 
very much from the sample analysis as a guide. As a starter, therefore, let me take again 
the first six chapters of this book. I must warn you at once that this is not a very good 
book. Its author is not what I should call a great mind. The book has a very loose 
structure. Its chapter divisions do not correspond to basic divisions of the whole 
treatment. And within the chapters the progression of points is often disorderly and 
interrupted by rambling digressions. You may have thought it was an easy book to read, 
but analysis will show that it is really not very readable. 
Here is an analysis of the first six chapters, comprising Part I, treated as a whole: 

1. This book (i.e.. Part I) is divided into three major parts: 
A. The first treats of the nature and kinds of reading, and the place of reading in 
education. 
B. The second treats of the failure of contemporary education with respect to reading. 
C. The third attempts to show how the contemporary educational situation can be 
remedied. 
2. The first part (A) is divided into the following sections: 
a. A first dealing with the varieties and degrees of reading ability; 
b. A second dealing with the major distinctions between reading for amusement and 
reading for instruction; 
c. A third dealing with the distinction, in reading for instruction, between information 
and understanding; 
d. A fourth dealing with the relation of this last distinction to one between active and 
passive reading; . 
e. A fifth which defines the sort of reading to be discussed as the reception of 
communications conveying knowledge; 
f. A sixth which relates reading to learning, by distinguishing between learning by 
discovery and learning by instruction; 
g. A seventh which treats of the relation of books and teachers, distinguishing them as 
dead and alive, and shows that reading is learning from dead teachers; 
h. An eighth which distinguishes between primary and secondary teachers, living or 
dead, and defines the great books as original communications, and hence primary 
teachers. 
The second part (B) is divided into the following sections: 
a. A first in which various evidences are recited, giving the writer's personal 
experiences with the inability of students to read; 
b. A second in which the relation of reading to such other skills as writing and speaking 
are discussed with respect to current educational defects; 
c. A third in which the results of scientific educa. tional measurements are reported to 
show the lack of these skills in the graduates of our schools; 
d. A fourth in which other evidences, especially from book publishers, are offered as 
corroborating these findings; 
e. A fifth in which an attempt is made to explain why the schools have failed. 
The third part (C) is divided into the following sections: 
a. A first in which it is shown that any art or skill can be acquired by those who will 
practice according to rules; 
b. A second in which it is indicated how the art of reading might be acquired by those 
who did not learn how in school; 
c. A third in which it is suggested that, by learning how to read, people can compensate 
for the defects of their education; 
d. A fourth in which it is hoped that if people generally understood what an education 
should be, through having learned to read and having read, they would take serious 
steps to reform the failing school system. 
3. In the first section of the first part, the following points are made: 

(1) That the readers of this book must be able to read in one sense, though perhaps not 
in another; 
(2) That individuals differ in their abilities to read, both according to their natural 
endowments and their educational benefits; 
(3) That most people do not know what is involved in the art of reading. . . . 
And so forth and so on. 
 
I stop here because you see how many pages it might take if I proceeded to do the job in 
detail. I would have to enumerate the points made in each of the sections of each of the 
major parts. You will notice that I have numbered tlie three main steps of analysis here 
to correspond to the tin ce parts of the formula I gave you some pages back. The first is 
the statement of the major parts; the second is their division into sections; the third is the 
enumeration of points in each section. I completed the first two stages of the analysis, 
but not the third. 
You will notice, furthermore, if you glance back over the six chapters I have thus 
analyzed, that they are not as well structured, not as orderly and clear, as I have made 
them out to be. Some of the points occur out of order. Some of the chapters overlap in 
their consideration of the same point or their treatment of the same theme. Such defects 
in organization are what I meant by saying this is not a very good book. If you try to 
complete the analysis I have started, you will find that out for yourself. 
I may be able to give you a few more examples of applying this rule if I do not try to 
carry the process out in all its details. Take the Constitution of the United States. That is 
an interesting, practical document, and a very well-organized piece of writing, indeed. 
You should have no difficulty in finding its major parts. They are pretty clearly 
indicated, though you have to do some analysis to make the main divisions. I suggest 
the following: 
First: 
 
The preamble, setting forth the purpose of the Constitution; 
Second: 
 
The first article, dealing with the legislative department of the government; 
Third: 
 
The second article, dealing with the executive department of the government; 
Fourth: 
 
The third article, dealing with the judicial department of the government; 
Fifth: 
 
The fourth article, dealing with the relationship between state and Federal 
governments; 
Sixth: 
 
The fifth, sixth, and seventh articles, dealing with the amendment of the 
Constitution, its status as the supreme law of the land, and provisions for its 
ratification; 
Seventh: 
 
The first ten amendments, constituting the Bill of Rights; 
Eighth: 
 
The remaining amendments up to the present day. 
 
This is only one way of doing the job. There are many others. The first three articles 
could be grouped together in one division, for instance; or instead of two divisions with 
respect to the amendments, more divisions could be introduced, grouping the 
amendments according to the problems they dealt with. I suggest that you try your hand 
at making your own division of the Constitution into its main parts. Go further than I 
did, and try to state the parts of the parts as well. You may have read the Constitution 
many times before this, but if you exercise this rule on it for another reading, you will 
find a lot there you never saw before. 

I am going to attempt one more example, with great brevity. I have already stated the 
unity of Aristotle's Ethics. Now let me give you a first approximation of its structure. 
The whole is divided into the following main parts: a first, treating of happiness as the 
end of life, and discussing it in relation to all other practicable goods; a second, treating 
of the nature of voluntary action, and its relation to the formation of virtuous and 
vicious habits; a third, discussing the various virtues and vices, both moral and 
intellectual; a fourth, dealing with moral states which are neither virtuous nor vicious; a 
fifth, treating of friendship, and a sixth and last, discussing pleasure, and completing the 
account of human happiness begun in the first. 
These divisions obviously do not correspond to the ten books of the Ethics. Thus, the 
first part is accomplished in the first book; the second part runs through book two and 
the first half of book three; the third part extends from the rest of book three to the end 
of the sixth book; the discussion of pleasure occurs at the end of book seven and again 
at the beginning of book ten. 
I mention all this to show you that you need not follow the apparent structure of a book 
as indicated by its chapter divisions. It may, of course, be better than the blueprint you 
develop, but it may also be worse; in any case, the point is to make your own blueprint. 
The author made his in order to write a good book. You must make yours in order to 
read it well. If he were a perfect writer and you a perfect reader, it would naturally 
follow that the two would be the same. In proportion as either of you or both fall away 
from perfection, all sorts of discrepancies will inevitably result. 
I do not mean that you should totally ignore chapter headings and sectional divisions 
made by the author. They are intended to help you, just as titles and prefaces are. But 
you must use them as guides for your own activity, and not rely on them passively. 
There are few authors who execute their plan perfectly, but there is often more plan in a 
great book than meets the eye at first. The surface can be deceiving. You must look 
beneath to discover the real structure. 
 - 6 - 
In general, these two rules of reading which we have been discussing look as if they 
were rules of writing also. Of course, they are. Writing and reading are reciprocal, as are 
teaching and being taught. If authors or teachers did not organize their communications, 
if they failed to unify them and order their parts, there would be no point in directing 
readers or listeners to search for the unity and uncover the structure of the whole. 
Though there are reciprocal rules in the two cases, they are not followed in the same 
way. The reader tries to uncover the skeleton the book conceals. The author starts with 
it and tries to cover it up. His aim is to conceal the skeleton artistically or, in other 
words, to put flesh on the bare bones. If he is a good writer, he does not bury a puny 
skeleton under a mass of fat. The joints should not show through where the flesh is thin, 
but if flabbiness is avoided, the joints will be detectible and the motion of the parts will 
revea) the ai ticulation. 
I made a mistake several years ago which was instructive on this point. I wrote a book 
in outline form. I was so obsessed with the importance of structure that I confused the 
arts of writing and reading. I outlined the structure of a book, and published it. 
Naturally, it was repulsive to most self-respecting readers who thought that they could 
do their job, if I did mine. I learned from their reactions that I had given them a reading 
of a book I had not written. Writers should write books and leave commentaries to 
readers. 

Let me summarize all this by reminding you of the old-fashioned maxim that a piece of 
writing should have unity, clarity, and coherence. That is a basic maxim of good 
writing. The two rules we have been discussing in this chapter respond to writing which 
follows that maxim. If the writing has unity, we must find it. If the writing has clarity 
and coherence, we must appreciate it by finding the distinction and the order of the 
parts. What is clear is so by the distinctness of its outlines. What is coherent hangs 
together in an orderly disposition of parts. 
These two rules, I might add, can be used in reading any substantial part of an 
expository book, as well as the whole. If the part chosen is itself a relatively 
independent, complex unity, its unity and complexity must be discerned for it to be well 
read. Here there is a significant difference between books conveying knowledge and 
poetical works, plays, and novels. The parts of the former can be much more 
autonomous than the parts of the latter. The student who is supposed to have read a 
novel and who says he has "read enough to get the idea" does not know what he is 
talking about. If the novel is any good at all, the idea is in the whole, and cannot be 
found short of reading the whole. But you can get the idea of Aristotle's Ethics or 
Darwin's The Origin of Species by reading some parts of it carefully. 
 - 7 - 
So long ago that you may have forgotten it, I mentioned fourth a rule to complete the 
first way of reading a book. It can be stated briefly. It needs little explanation and no 
illustration. It really repeats in another form what you have already done if you have 
applied the second and third rules. But it is a useful repetition because it throws the 
whole and its parts into another light. 
This fourth rule requires you to find out what the author's problems were. This rule is 
most pertinent, of course, to the great books. If you remember that they are original 
communications, you will realize that the man who wrote them started out with 
problems and ended by writing what the solutions were. A problem is a question. The 
book ostensibly contains one or more answers to it. 
The writer may or may not tell you what the questions were as well as give you the 
answers which are the fruits of his work. Whether he does or does not, and especially if 
he does not, it is your task as a reader to formulate the problem as precisely as you can. 
You should be able to state the main problem or problems which the book tries to 
answer, and you should be able to state the subordinate problems if the main questions 
are complex and have many parts. You should not only have a fairly adequate grasp of 
all the questions involved, but you should be able to put the questions in an intelligible 
order. Which are primary and v/hicb secondary? Which questions must be answered 
first, if others are/to be answered later? 
You see how this fourth rule duplicates, in a sense, work you have already done in 
stating the unity and finding its parts. It may, however, actually help you to do that 
work. In other words, following the fourth rule is a useful procedure in conjunction with 
obeying the other two. 
If you know the kinds of questions anyone can ask about anything, you will become 
adept in detecting an author's problems. They can be briefly formulated. Does 
something exist? What kind of thing is it? What caused it to exist, or under what 
conditions can it exist, or why does it exist? What purpose does it serve? What are the 
consequences of its existence? What are its characteristic properties, its typical traits? 
What are its relations to other things of a similar sort, or of a different sort? How does it 

behave? The foregoing are all theoretical questions. The following are practical. What 
ends should be sought? What means should be chosen to a given end? What things must 
one do to gain a certain objective, and in what order? Under these conditions, what is 
the right thing to do, or the better rather than the worse? Under what conditions would it 
be better to do this rather than that? 
This list of questions is far from being exhaustive or analytically refined, but it does 
represent the types of most frequently asked questions in the pursuit of theoretic or 
practical knowledge. It may help you to discover the problems a book has tried to solve. 
When you have followed the tour rules stated in this chapter and the previous one, you 
can put down the book you have in hand for a moment. You can sigh and say: "Here 
endeth the first reading." 
 CHAPTER TEN 
Coming to Terms 
 - 1 - 
where are we? 
We have seen that any good book deserves three readings. They have to be done 
separately and consciously when we are learning to read, though they can be done 
together and unconsciously when we are expert. We have discovered that there are four 
rules for the first, or analytical, reading. They are: (i) classify the book according to kind 
and subject matter; (2) state what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity; (3) 
define its major parts in their order and relation, and analyze these parts as you have 
analyzed the whole; (4) define the problem or problems the authors trying to solve. 
You are now prepared to go on with the second reading, and its four rules. You are 
already somewhat acquainted with the first of these rules. It was stated in the second 
chap ter of this book: spot the important words an author uses and figure out how he 
uses them. We then put this rule into operation by running down the various meanings 
of such words as "reading" and "learning." When in any context you knew precisely 
what I meant when I used these words, you had come to terms with me. 
Coming to terms is nearly the last stage in any successful business negotiation. All that 
remains is to sign on the dotted line. But in the reading of a book, coming to terms is the 
first stage of interpretation. Unless the reader comes to terms with the author, the 
communication of knowledge from one to the other does not take place. A term, as you 
will see shortly, is the basic element of communicable knowledge. 
But you can see at once that a term is not a word！at least, not just a word without any 
further qualifications. If a term and a word were exactly the same, you would only have 
to find the important words in a book and you would know its basic terms immediately. 
But a word can have many meanings, especially an important word. If the author uses a 
word in one meaning, and the reader reads it in another, words have passed between 
them, but they have not come to terms. Where there is unresolved ambiguity in 
communication, there is no communication, or at best it must be incomplete. 
Just look at the word "communication" for a moment. Its root is related to the word 
"common." We speak of a community when people have something in common. 
Communication is an effort on the part of one man to share something with another: his 

knowledge, his decisions, his sentiments. It succeeds only when it results in a common 
something, as an item of knowledge which two men have in common. 
Now when there is ambiguity in communication, all that is in common are the words 
which one man speaks or writes and another hears or reads. So long as ambiguity 
remains, there are no meanings in common between writer and reader. For the 
communication to be successfully completed, therefore, it is necessary for the two 
parties to use the same words with the same meanings. When that happens, 
communication happens, the miracle of two minds with but a single thought. 
A term can be defined as an unambiguous word. That is not quite accurate, for strictly 
there are no unambiguous words. What I should have said is that a term is a word used 
unambiguously. The dictionary is full of words. They are almost all ambiguous in the 
sense that they have many meanings. Look up any word and find this out for yourself, if 
you think there are many exceptions to this generalization. But a word which has 
several meanings can be used in one sense at a time. When you and I together, as writer 
and reader, somehow manage for a time to use a given word with one meaning, then, 
during that time of unambiguous usage, we have come to terms. I think we did manage 
to come to terms in the matter of reading and learning, for instance. 
You cannot find terms in dictionaries, though the materials for making them are there. 
Terms occur only in the process of communication. They occur when a writer tries to 
avoid ambiguity and a reader helps him by trying to follow his use of words. There are, 
of course, many degrees of success in this business. Coming to terms is the ideal limit 
toward which writer and reader should strive. Since this is one of the. primary 
achievements of the art of writing and reading, we can think of terms as an artistic use 
of words, a skilled use of words for the sake of communicating knowledge. 
Let me restate the rule for you. As I phrased it originally, it was: spot the important 
words and figure out how the author is using them. Now I can make that a little more 
precise and elegant: find the important words and through them come to terms with the 
author. Note that the rule has two parts. The first step is to locate the words which make 
a difference. The second is to determine their meanings, as used, with precision. 
This is the first rule for the second way of reading, the interpretative reading. The other 
rules, to be discussed in the next chapter, are like this first one in an important respect. 
They, also, require you to take two steps: a step dealing with the language as such, and a 
step beyond the language to the thought which lies behind it. 
If language were a pure and perfect medium for thought, these steps would not be 
separate. If every word had only one meaning, if words could not be used ambiguously, 
if, in short, each word was an ideal term, language would be a diaphanous medium. The 
reader would see straight through the writer's words to the content of his mind. If that 
were the case, there would be no need at all for this second way of reading. 
Interpretation would be unnecessary. 
But you know that that is far from being the case. There is no use in crying about it, no 
use in faking up impossible schemes for an ideal language, as the philosopher Leibnitz 
and some of his followers have tried to do. The only thing to do is to make the best of 
language as it is, and the only way to do that is to use language as skillfully as possible. 
Because language is imperfect as a medium, it also functions as an obstacle to 
communication. The rules of interpretative reading are directed to overcoming that 
obstacle. We can expect a good writer to do his best to reach us through the barrier 

language inevitably sets up, but we cannot expect him to do it all. In fact, we must meet 
him halfway. We, as readers, must try to tunnel through from our side. The chance of a 
meeting of minds through language depends on the willingness of both reader and 
writer to work toward each other. Just as teaching will not avail unless there is a 
reciprocal activity o♀ being taught, so no author, regardless of his skill in writing, can 
achieve communication without a reciprocal skill on the part of readers. The reciprocity 
here is founded on the fact that the rules of good reading and writing are ultimately the 
same in principle. If that were not so, the diverse skills of writing and reading would not 
bring minds together, however much effort was expended, any more than the men who 
tunnel through from opposite sides of a mountain would ever meet unless they made 
their calculations according to the same principles of engineering. 
You have noted that each of the rules of interpretative reading involves two steps. Let 
me shift from the engineering analogy to explain how they are related. They can be 
likened to the two steps a detective takes in pursuing the murderer. Of all the things 
which lie around the scene of the crime, he must pick~out those he thinks are likely to 
be clues. He must then use these clues in running down the culprit. Interpreting a book 
is a kind of detective work. Finding the important words is locating the clues. Coming 
to terms through them is running down the author's thought. 
If I were to get technical for a moment, I should say that ihese rules have a grammatical 
and a logical aspect. The grammatical step is the one which deals with words. The 
logical step deals with their meanings or, more precisely, with terms. So far as 
communication is concerned, both steps are indispensable. If language is used without 
thought, nothing is being communicated. And thought or knowledge cannot be 
communicated without language. As arts, grammar and logic are concerned with 
language in relation to thought and thought in relation to language. That is why I said 
earlier that skill in reading and writing is gained through these liberal arts, especially 
grammar and logic. 
This business of language and thought！especially the distinction between words and 
terms！is so important that I am going to risk being repetitious to be sure you 
understand the main point. The main point is that one word can be the vehicle for many 
terms. Let me illustrate this schematically in the following manner. The word "reading" 
has been used in many senses in the course of our discussion. Let us take three of the 
meanings: (i) reading in the sense of getting amusement; (2) reading in the sense of 
getting information, and (3) reading in the sense of gaining insight. 
Now let us symbolize the word "reading" by the letter X, and the three meanings by the 
letters a, b, and c. What is symbolized, then by Xa, Xb, and Xc, are not three words, for 
X remains the same throughout. But they are three terms, on the condition, of course, 
that you and I know when X is being used in one definite sense, and not another. If I 
write Xa in a given place, and you read Xb, we are writing and reading the same word, 
but not in the same way. The ambiguity prevents communication. Only when you think 
the word as I think it do we have one thought between us. Our minds cannot meet in X, 
but only in Xa or Xb or Xc. Thus we come to terms. 
 - 2 - 
You are prepared now, I hope, to consider the rule which requires a reader to come to 
terms. How does he go about taking the first step? How does he find the important 
worda in a book? 

You can be sure of one thing. Not all the words an author uses are important. Better 
than that, you can be sure that most of his words are not. Only those words which he 
uses in a special way are important tor him, and for us as readers. This is not an absolute 
matter, of course, but one of degree. Words may be more or less important. Our only 
concern is with the tact that some words in a book are more important than others. At 
one extreme are the words which the author uses as the proverbial man in the street 
does. Since the author is using these words as ordinary men do in ordinary discourse, 
the reader should have no trouble with them. He is familiar with their ambiguity and he 
has grown accustomed to the variation in their meanings as they occur in this context or 
that. 
For example, the word "reading" occurs in Sir Arthur Eddington's fine book on The 
Nature of the Physical World, He speaks of "pointer-readings," the readings of dials and 
gauges on scientific instruments. He is using the word "reading" in one of its ordinary 
senses. It is not for him a technical word. He can rely on ordinary usage to convey what 
he means to the reader. Even if he used the word "reading" in a different sense 
somewhere else in his book-in a phrase, let us say, such as "reading nature"！he could 
be confident that the reader would note the shift to another of the word's ordinary 
meanings. The reader who could not do this could not talk to his friends or carry on his 
daily business. 
But Sir Arthur cannot use the word "cause" so light-heartedly. That may be a word of 
common speech, but Sir Arthur is using it in a definitely special sense when he 
discusses the theory of causation. How that word is to be under-Btood makes a 
difference which both he and the reader must bother about. For the same reason, the 
word "reading" is important in this book. We cannot get along with using it in an 
ordinary way. 
I repeat that an author uses most words as men ordinarily do in conversation, with a 
range of meanings, and trusting to context to indicate the shifts. Knowing this fact 
should be of some help to you in detecting the more important words. There is one 
qualification here. We must not forget that at different times and places the same words 
are not equally familiar items in daily usage. A contemporary like Eddington or me will 
employ most words as they are ordinarily used today, and you will know what these are 
because you are alive today. But in reading the great books of the past, it may be more 
difficult to detect the words the author is using as most men did at the time and place he 
was writing. The translation of books from foreign languages complicates the matter 
further. 
You can see, therefore, why eliminating the ordinary words may be a rough 
discrimination. Nevertheless, it remains true that most of the words in any book can be 
read just as one would use them in talking to one's friends. Take any page of this book 
and count the words which we are using that way: all the prepositions, conjunctions, and 
articles, and certainly most of the verbs, nouns, and adjectives. In this chapter so far, I 
would say that there have been only a few important words: "word," "term," 
"ambiguity," "communication," "important"; of these, "term" is clearly the most 
important. All the others are important in relation to it. 
You cannot locate the important words without making an effort to understand the 
passage in which they occur. This situation is somewhat paradoxical. If you do 
understand the passage, you will, of course, know which words in it are the most 
important. If you do not fully understand the passage, it is probably because you do not 
know the way the author is using certain words. It you mark the words that trouble you, 
you may hit the very ones the author is using specially^ That this is likely to be so 

follows from the fact that you should have no trouble with the words the author uses in 
an ordinary way. 
From your point of view as a reader, the most important words are those which give you 
trouble. As I have said, it is likely that these words are important for the author as well. 
The opposite is possible, of course. They may not be. 
It is also possible that words which are important for the author do not bother you, and 
precisely because you understand them. In that case, you have already come to terms 
with the author. Only where you'fail to come to terms have you work still to do. 
 - 3 - 
So far we have been proceeding negatively by eliminating the ordinary words. You 
discover some of the important words by the fact that they are not ordinary for you. 
That is why they bother you. But is there any other way of spotting the important 
words? Are there any positive signs which point to them? 
There are several positive signs I can suggest. The first and most obvious sign is the 
explicit stress an author places upon certain words and not others. He may do this in 
many ways. He may use such typographical devices as quotation marks or italics to 
mark the word for you. He may call your attention to the word by explicitly discussing 
its various senses and the way he is going to use it here and there. Or he may emphasize 
the word by defining the thing which the word is used to name. 
No one can read Euclid without knowing that such words as "point," "line," "plane," 
"angle," "figure," "parallel," and so forth are of the first importance. These are the words 
which name geometrical entities that Euclid defines. There are other important words, 
such as "equals," "whole," and "part," but these do not name anything which is defined. 
You know that they are important from the fact that they occur in the axioms. Euclid 
helps you here by making his primary propositions explicit at the very beginning. You 
can guess that the terms which compose such propositions are basic, and that underlines 
for you the words which express these terms. You may have no difficulty with these 
words, because they are words of common speech, and Euclid appears to be using them 
that way. 
If all authors wrote as Euclid did, you may say, this business of reading would be much 
easier. Unfortunately, that is not possible, although some men have thought that any 
subject matter can be expounded in the geometrical manner. I shall not try to explain 
why the procedure！the method of exposition and proof！which works in mathematics 
is not applicable in other fields of knowledge. For our purposes, it is sufficient to note 
what is common to every sort of exposition. Every field of knowledge has its own 
technical vocabulary. Euclid makes his plain right at the beginning. The same is true of 
any writer, such as Newton or Galileo, who writes in the geometrical manner. In books 
differently written or in other fields, the technical vocabulary must be discovered by the 
reader. 
If the author has not pointed out the words himself, the reader may locate them through 
having some prior knowledge of the subject matter. If he knows something about 
biology or economics before he begins to read Darwin or Adam Smith, he certainly has 
some leads toward discerning the technical words. The various steps of the first reading 
may be helpful here. If you know what kind of book it is, what it is about as a whole, 
and what its major parts are, you are greatly aided in separating the technical vocabulary 

from the ordinary words. The author's title, chapter headings, and preface may be useful 
in this connection. 
Now you know that "wealth" is a technical word for Adam Smith, and "species" is one 
for Darwin. And as one technical word leads to another, you cannot help but -discover 
other technical words in a similar fashion. You can soon make a list of the important 
words used by Adam Smith: labor, capital, land, wages, profits, rent, commodity, price, 
exchange, productive, unproductive, money, and so forth. And here are some you 
cannot miss in Darwin: variety, genus, selection, survival, adaptation, hybrid, fittest, 
creation. 
Where a field of knowledge has a well-established technical vocabulary, the task of 
locating the important words in a book treating that subject matter is relatively easy. 
You can spot them positively through having some acquaintance with the field, or 
negatively by knowing what words must be technical, because they are not ordinary. 
Unfortunately, there are many fields in which a technical vocabulary is not well 
established. 
Philosophers are notorious for having private vocabularies. There are some words, of 
course, which have a traditional standing in philosophy. Though they may not be used 
by all writers in the same sense, they are nevertheless technical words in the discussion 
of certain problems. But philosophers often find it necessary to coin new words, or to 
take some word from common speech and make it a technical word. This last procedure 
is likely to be most misleading to the reader who supposes that he knows what the word 
means, and therefore treats it as an ordinary word. 
In this connection, one clue to an important word is that the author quarrels with other 
writers about it. When you find an author telling you how a particular word has been 
used by others, and why he chooses to use it differently, you can be pretty sure that that 
word makes a great difference to him. 
I have emphasized the notion of technical vocabulary, but you must not take this too 
narrowly. The relatively small set of words which express the author's main ideas, his 
leading concepts, constitutes his special vocabulary. They are the words which carry his 
analysis. If he is making an original communication, some of these words are likely to 
be used by him in a very special way, although he may use others in a fashion which has 
become traditional in that field. In either case, these are the words which are most 
important for him. They should be important for you as a reader also, but in addition any 
other word whose meaning is not clear is important for you. 
 - 4 - 
The trouble with most readers is that they simply do not pay enough attention to words 
to locate their difficulties. They fail to distinguish the words they do not understand 
sufficiently from those they do. All the things I have suggested to help you find the 
important words in a book will be of no avail unless you make a deliberate effort to note 
the words you must work on to find the terms they convey. The reader who fails to 
ponder, or at least to mark, the words he does not understand is likely to end up as badly 
as the locomotive engineer who drives past red signals in the hope .that the traffic 
congestion will straighten itself out. 
If you are reading a book that can increase your understanding, it stands to reason that 
all its words will not be equally intelligible. If you proceed as if they were all ordinary 
words, all on the same level of general intelligibility as the words of a newspaper 

article, you will not make the first step toward an interpretative reading. You might just 
as well be reading a newspaper, for the book cannot enlighten you if you do not try to 
understand ,it. 
I know how inveterately most of us are addicted to pas' sive reading. The outstanding 
fault of the passive reader is his inattention to words, and his consequent failure to come 
to terms with the author. Some years ago Professor Malcolm Sharp, of the University of 
Chicago Law School, and I gave a special course for students who were planning to 
study law. One of our primary aims was to teach them how to read and write. A lawyer 
should possess these abilities. The faculty of the Law School had come to suspect that 
the colleges could not be counted on to develop these skills. Our experience with these 
students, who had reached their junior year, showed their suspicion to be well founded. 
We soon discovered how passively they read. John Locke's second essay Of Civil 
Government had been assigned, and they had had several weeks in which to read about 
a hundred pages. The class met. Mr. Sharp and I asked relatively simple, leading 
questions about Locke's views on government, the relation of natural and civil rights, 
the nature of liberty, and so forth. They answered these questions, but not in a way 
which showed any acquaintance with Locke. They could have made the same replies if 
they had never opened Locke's essay. 
Had they read the book? They assured us they had. We even inquired whether they had 
make the mistake of reading the first essay, rather than the second. There was no 
mistake, it seemed. The only thing left to do was to show them that, though they may 
have looked at every page, they had not read the book. 
I went to the board and asked them to call out the most important words in the essay. I 
said I wanted either those words which were most important for Locke or those which 
they had trouble in understanding. At first there was no response. Only after I put such 
words as "natural," "civil," "property," and "equality," on the board was I able to get 
them to contribute. We finally did get a list which included "liberty," "despotism," 
"consent (of the governed)," "rights," "justice," and so forth. 
Before I went further, I paused to ask whether these words were utterly strange to them. 
No, they were all familiar and ordinary words, they said. One student pointed out that 
some of these words occurred in the Declaration of Independence. It was said there to 
be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain 
inalienable rights, that the just powers of government are derived from the consent of 
the governed. They found other words, such as "despotism," "usurpation," and "liberty," 
which they thought Locke and the founding fathers probably used in a similar way. 
That was our cue. We agreed that the writers of the Declaration and the framers of the 
Constitution had made these words extremely popular in the tradition of American 
political discussion. Mr. Sharp added that many of them had probably read Locke's 
essay and had followed his usage of them. How did Locke use them? What were their 
meanings, not in general, not in popular speech, but in Locke's political theory, and in 
the great American documents which may have been influenced by Locke? 
I went to the board again to write down the meaning! of the words as they suggested 
them. But few suggestions were forthcoming, and seldom did a student offer a set of 
meanings. Few had discovered the fundamental ambiguity of the important words. Mr. 
Sharp and I then listed the meanings of the words, not one meaning for each, but 
several. By contrasting the meanings of "natural" and "civil," we tried to show them 

Locke's distinctions between natural and civil equality, natural and civil liberty, and 
natural and civil rights. 
At the end of the hour, I asked them whether they still thought that they had read the 
book. A little sheepishly now they admitted that perhaps they hadn't. They had, of 
course, read it in the way they read the newspaper or a textbook. They had read it 
passively, without any attention to words and meanings. For the purpose of 
understanding what Locke had to say that was just the same as not reading it at all. Here 
were a group of future lawyers who did not know the meaning of the leading words in 
the Declaration of Independence or the preamble to the Constitution. 
My point in telling this story is to show that until passive reading is overcome, the 
reader proceeds as if he knew what all the words meant, especially if he is reading 
something in which the important words also happen to be words in popular usage. Had 
these students developed the habit of active reading, they would have noted the words I 
have mentioned. They would have known, in the first place, that such words are not 
only popular but belong to the technical vocabulary of political theory. Recognizing 
that, they would, in the second place, have wondered about their technical meanings. 
And finally, if they had tried to determine their significance, they would have found 
Locke using these words in several senses. Then they might have realized the need to 
come to terms with the author. 
I should add that the lesson was learned. With these same students, we subsequently 
read more difficult books than Locke's essay. They came to class better prepared for 
discussion, because they had marked the words that made a crucial difference. They had 
pursued important words through their shifts of meaning. What is more, they were 
beginning to enjoy a new experience！the active reading of a book. It came a little late 
in their college life, but most of them gratefully acknowledged that it was better late 
than never. 
 - 5 - 
Remember that spotting the important words is only the beginning of the task. It merely 
locates the places in the text where you have to go to work. There is another step in 
carrying out this first rule of interpretative reading. Let us turn to that now. Let us 
suppose that you have marked the words that trouble you. What next? 
There are two major possibilities. Either the author is using these words in a single 
sense throughout or he is using them in two or more senses, shifting his meaning from 
place to place. In the first alternative, the word stands for a single term. A good example 
of the use of important words so that they are restricted to a single meaning is found in 
Euclid. In the second alternative, the word stands for several terms. This is the more 
usual case. It is illustrated by the usage in Locke's essay. 
In the light of these alternatives, your procedure should be as follows. First, try to 
determine whether the word has one or many meanings. If it has many, try to see 
whether they are related and how. Finally, note the places where the word is used in one 
sense or another, and see if the context gives you any clue to the reason for the shift in 
mean- . ing. This last will enable you to follow the word in its change of meanings with 
the same flexibility that characterizes the author's usage. 
But, you may complain, everything is clear except the main thing. How does one find 
out what the meanings are? There is only one answer to the question. I fear you may not 
think it a very satisfactory one. But patience and practice will show you otherwise. The 

answer is that you have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by 
using the meanings of all the other words in the context which you do understand. This 
must be the way, however merry-go-roundish it may seem at first. 
The simplest way to illustrate this is to consider a definition. A definition is stated in 
words. If you do not understand any of the words used in the definition, you obviously 
cannot understand the meaning of the word which names the thing being defined. The 
word "point" is a basic word in geometry. You may think you know what it means, but 
Euclid wants to be sure you use it in only one way. He tells you what he means by first 
defining the thing which he is later going to use the word to name. He says: "A point is 
that which has no parts." 
How does that bring you to terms with him? You know, he assumes, what every other 
word in the sentence means with sufficient precision. You know that whatever has parts 
is a complex whole. You know that the opposite of complex is simple. To be simple is 
the same as to lack parts. You know that the use of the words "is" and "that which" 
means that the thing referred to must be an entity of some sort. You may even know that 
there are no physical things without parts, and hence that a point, as Euclid speaks of it, 
cannot be physical. 
This illustration is typical of the process by which you acquire meanings. You operate 
with meanings you already possess. If every word that was used in a definition had itself 
to be denned, nothing could ever be defined. If every word in a book you were reading 
were entirely strange to you, a? it is in the case of a book in a totally foreign lan guage, 
you could make no prpgress at all. 
I suppose that is what people mean when they say of a book that it's all Greek to them. 
They simply have not tried to understand it. Most of the words in any English book are 
familiar words. These words surround the strange words, the technical words, the words 
that may cause the reader some trouble. The surrounding words are the context for the 
words to be interpreted. The reader has all the materials he needs to do the job. 
I am not pretending the job is an easy one. I am only insisting that it is not an 
impossible one. If it were, no one could read a book to gain in understanding. The fact 
that a book can give you new insights or enlighten you indicates that it probably 
contains words you may not readily understand. If you could not come to understand 
these words by your own efforts, then the kind of reading we are talking about would be 
impossible. It would be impossible to pass from understanding less to understanding 
more by your own operations on a book. 
If it is not impossible！and it is not！then the only solution is the one I have indicated. 
Because you understand something to begin with, you can employ your fund of 
meanings to interpret the words that challenge you. When you have succeeded, you 
have elevated yourself in understanding. You have approached or reached the 
understanding with which the author began. 
There is no rule of thumb for doing this. The process is something like the trial-and-
error method of putting a jigsaw puzzle together. The more parts you put together, the 
more easily the remaining parts fit. A book comes to you with a large number of words 
already in place. A word in place is a term. It is definitely located by the meaning which 
you and the author share in using it. The remaining words must be put into place. You 
do this by trying to make them fit this way or that. The better you understand the picture 
which the words so far in place incompletely reveal, the easier it is to complete the 

picture by making terms of the remaining words. Each word put into place makes the 
next adjustment easier. 
You will make errors, of course, in the process. You will think you have managed to 
find where a word belongs and how it fits, only to discover later that the placement of 
another word requires you to make a whole series of readjustments. The errors will get 
corrected because, so long as they are not found out, the picture cannot be completed. 
Once you have had any experience at all in this work of coming to terms, you will soon 
be able to check yourself. You will know whether you have succeeded or not. You will 
not blithely think you understand when you do not. 
In comparing a book to a jigsaw puzzle, I have made one assumption that is not simply 
or universally true. A good puzzle is, of course, one all of whose parts fit. The picture 
can be perfectly completed. The same is true of the ideally good book. But there are few 
books of this sort. In proportion as they are good, their terms will be so well made and 
put together by the author that the reader can do the work of interpretation fruitfully. 
Here, as in the case of every other rule of reading, bad books are less readable than good 
ones. The rules do not work on them, except to show you how bad they are. If the 
author uses words ambiguously, you cannot find out precisely what he is trying to say. 
You can only find out that he has not been precise. 
But, you may ask, doesn't an author who uses a word in more than a single sense use it 
ambiguously? And didn't you say that the usual practice is for authors to use words in 
several senses, especially their most important words? 
The answer to the second question is Yes, to the first. No. To use a word ambiguously is 
to use it in several senses Without distinguishing or relating these meanings. (For 
example, I have probably used the word "important" ambiguously in this chapter, never 
quite clear as to whether I mean important for the author or important for you.) The 
author who does that has not made terms which the reader can come to. But the author 
who distinguishes the several senses in which he is using a critical word and enables the 
reader to make a responsive discrimination is offering terms. 
You must not forget that one word can represent several terms. One way to remember 
this is to distinguish between the author's technical vocabulary and his analytical 
terminology. If you make a list in one column of the important words, and in another of 
their various meanings, you will see the relation between the vocabulary and the 
terminology. 
 - 6 - 
There are several further complications. In the first place, a word which has several 
distinct meanings .can be used either in a single sense or in a combination of senses. Let 
me take the word "reading" again as an example. In some places, I have used it to stand 
for reading any kind of book. In others, I have used it to stand for reading books which 
instruct rather than amuse. In still others, I have used it to stand for reading which 
enlightens rather than informs. 
Now it we symbolize here, as we did before, the three distinct meanings of "reading" by 
Xa, Xb, and Xc, you can see that the first usage just mentioned is Xabc, the second is 
Xbc, and the third Xc. In other words, if three meanings are related, one can use a word 
to stand for all of them, for some of them, or for only one of them at a time. So long as 
each usage is definite, the word so used is a term. 

In the second place, there is the problem of synonyms. You know in general that 
synonyms are words which have the same meaning or closely related shades of 
meaning. A pair of synonyms is exactly the opposite of a single word used in two ways. 
Synonyms are two words used in the same way. Hence one and the same term can be 
represented by two or more words used synonymously. 
We can indicate this symbolically as follows. Let X and V be two different words, such 
as "enlightenment" and "in-sight." Let the letter a stand for the same meaning which 
each can express, namely, a gain in understanding. Then Xa and Ya represent the same 
term, though they are distinct as words. When I speak of reading "for insight" and 
reading "for enlightenment," I am referring to the same kind of reading, because the two 
phrases are being used with the same meaning. The words are different, but there is only 
one term here for you as a reader to grasp. 
You can see why this is important. If you supposed that every time an author changed 
his words, he was shifting his terms, you would make as great an error as to suppose 
that every time he used the same words, the terms remained the same. Keep this in mind 
when you list the author's vocabulary and terminology in separate columns. You will 
find two relationships. On the one hand, a single word may be related to several terms. 
On the other, a single term may be related to several words. 
That this is generally the case results from the nature of language in relation to thought. 
A dictionary is a record of the usage of words. It shows how men have used tlie same 
word to refer to different things, and different words to refer to the same thing. The 
reader's problem is to know what the author is doing with words at any place in the 
book. The dictionary may help sometimes, but if the writer departs in the least from 
common usage, the reader is on his own. 
In the third place, and finally, there is the matter of phrases. A phrase, as you know, is a 
group of words which does not express a complete thought as a sentence does. If the 
phrase is a unit, that is, if it is a whole which can be the subject or predicate of a 
sentence, it is like a single word. Like a single word, it can refer to something being 
talked about in some way. 
It follows, therefore, that a term can be expressed by a phrase as well as by a word. And 
all the relations which exist between words and terms hold also between terms and 
phrases. Two phrases may express the same terms, and one phrase may express several 
terms, according to the way its constituent words are used. 
In general, a phrase is less likely to be ambiguous than a word. Because it is a group of 
words, each of which is in the context of the others, the single words are more likely to 
have restricted meanings. That is why a writer is likely to substitute a fairly elaborate 
phrase for a single word if he wants to be sure that you get his meaning. 
One illustration should suffice. To be sure that you come to terms with me about 
reading, I substitute the phrase "reading for enlightenment" for the single word 
"reading." To make doubly sure, I may even substitute a more elaborate phrase, such as 
"the process of passing from understanding less to understanding more by the operation 
or your mind upon a book." There is only one term herz, namely, the reference to a kind 
of reading which I am trying to talk about. But that one term has been expressed by a 
single word, a short phrase, and a longer one. 
This has probably been the hardest chapter for you to read so far. I know it has been the 
hardest for me to write. I think I know the reason why. The rule of reading we have 

been discussing cannot be made fully intelligible without going into all sorts of 
grammatical and logical explanations about words and terms. 
I assure you I have done very little explaining. To give an adequate account of these 
matters would take many chapters. I say this to warn you that I have merely touched the 
most essential points. I hope I have said enough to make the rule a useful guide in 
practice. The more you put it into practice, the more you will appreciate the intricacies 
of the problem. You will want to know something about the literal and metaphorical use 
of words. You will want to know about the distinction between abstract and concrete 
words, or between proper and common names. You will become interested in the whole 
business of definitions: the difference between defining words and defining things; why 
some words are indefinable, and yet have definite meanings, and so forth. You will seek 
light on what is called "the emotive use of words," that is, the use of words to arouse 
emotions, to move men to action or change their minds, as distinct from the 
communication of knowledge. 
If the practice of reading elicits these further interests, you will be in a position to 
satisfy them by reading books on these special subjects. And you will profit more from 
reading such books, because you will go to them with questions born of your own 
experience in reading. The study of grammar and logic, the sciences which underlie 
these rules of interpretation, is practical only to the extent you can relate it to practice. 
 
 CHAPTER ELEVEN 
What's the Proposition and Why 
 - 1 - 
not only coming to terms but making propositions occurs among traders as well as in 
the world of books. What a buyer or seller means by a proposition is some sort of 
proposal, some sort of offer or acceptance. Ip honest dealings, the man v.'ho makes a 
proposition in this sense is declaring his intention to act in a certain way. More than 
honesty is needed for successful negotiations. The proposition should be clear and, of 
course, attractive. Then the traders can come to terms. 
A proposition in a book is also a declaration. It is an expression of the author's judgment 
about something. He affirms something he thinks true, or denies something he judges to 
be false. He asserts this or that to be a fact. A proposition of this sort is a declaration of 
knowledge, not intentions. The author may tell us his intentions at the beginning in a 
preface. In an expository book, he usually promises to instruct us about something. To 
find out whether he keeps those promises, we must look for his propositions. 
The order of reading reverses the order of business somewhat. Businessmen come to 
terms after they find out what the proposition is. But the reader must usually come to 
terms with an author first, before he can find out what the author is proposing, what 
judgments he is declaring. That is why the first rule of interpretation concerns words 
and terms, and the second, which we are about to discuss, concerns sentences and 
propositions. 
There is a third rule of interpretation closely related to the second. The author may be 
honest in declaring himself on matters of fact or knowledge. We usually proceed in that 
trust. But honesty is not enough. Unless we are exclusively interested in the author's 

personality, we should not be satisfied with knowing what his opinions are. His 
propositions are nothing but expressions of opinion unless there is some reason for 
them. If it is the subject matter of the book we are interested in, and not just the author, 
we want to know not merely what the propositions are, but why. 
The third rule, therefore, deals with arguments of all sorts. There are many kinds of 
reasoning, many ways of supporting what one says. Sometimes it is possible to argue 
that something is true; sometimes no more than a probability can be defended. But 
every sort of argument consists of a number of statements related in a certain way. This 
is said because of that. The word "because" here signifies a reason being given. 
The presence of arguments is indicated by other words which relate statements, such as: 
if this is so, then that; or, since this, therefore that; or, it follows from this, that that is the 
case. In the course of earlier chapters, such sequences occurred. If thinking, I said, is the 
use of our minds to gain knowledge, and if we use our minds to gain knowledge only in 
two ways, either in being taught or in investigating, then, I said, we must conclude that 
all the thinking we do occurs in the course of one or the other of these two activities. 
An argument is always a set or series of statements of which some provide the grounds 
or reasons for what is to be concluded. It, therefore, takes a paragraph, or at least a 
collection of sentences, to express an argument. The premises or principles of an 
argument may not always be stated first, but they are the source of the conclusion, 
nevertheless. If the argument is valid, the conclusion follows from the premises. That 
does not necessarily mean that the conclusion is true, because the premises 
which'support it may be false, one or all. 
Perhaps you have already observed something about the sequence of these three rules. 
We go from terms to propositions to arguments, by going from words (and phrases) to 
sentences to collections cf sentences or paragraphs. 
When grammar was still taught in the schools, everyone was acquainted with these 
units. A schoolboy knew that an orderly sequence of sentences made up a paragraph. 
My experience with college students in the last ten years makes me doubt that this 
simple knowledge is common any longer. They do not seem able to write or speak 
sentences and paragraphs, and that has made me wonder whether they can recognize 
them in the books they read. 
You will notice, furthermore, that we are now moving in the direction of building up 
from simpler to more complex units. The smallest significant element in a book is. of 
course, a single word. It would be true but not adequate to say that a book consists of 
words. It also consists of groups of words, taken as a unit, and similarly groups of 
sentences, taken as a unit. The reader, who is active rather than passive, is attentive not 
only to the words but to the sentences and paragraphs. There is no other way of 
discovering the author's terms, oropositions, and arguments, 
The movement of this second or interpretative reading seems to be in the opposite 
direction to the movement of the first or structural reading. There we went from the 
book as a whole to its major parts, and then to their subordinate divisions. As you might 
suspect, the two movements meet somewhere. The major parts of a book and even their 
principal divisions contain many propositions and usually several arguments. But if you 
keep on dividing the book into its parts, you at last have to say: "In this part, the 
following points are made." Now each of these points is likely to be a proposition, and 
some of them taken together probably form an argument. 

Thus, the two processes, which we have called the first and the second reading, meet. 
You work down to propositions and arguments by dividing the book into its parts. You 
work up to arguments by seeing how they are composed of propositions and ultimately 
of terms. When you have completed these two readings, you can really say you know 
the contents of a book. 
 - 2 - 
There is one other thing to be noticed about the rules we are going to discuss in this 
chapter. As in the case of the rule about words and terms, we are here also dealing with 
the relation of language and thought. Sentences and paragraphs are grammatical units. 
They are units of language. Propositions and arguments are logical units, or units of 
thought and knowledge. 
If you remember what our main problem was in the last chapter, you will be prepared to 
face a similar one here. Because language is not a perfect medium for the expression of 
thought, because one word can have many meanings and two or more words can have 
the same meaning, we saw how complicated was the relation between an author's 
vocabulary and his terminology. One word may represent several terms, and one term 
may be represented by several words. 
Mathematicians describe the relation between the buttons and buttonholes on a well-
made coat as a perfect one-to-one relationship. There is a button for every buttonhole, 
and a hole for every button. Well, the point is that words and terms do not stand in a 
one-to-one relation. The greatest error you can make in applying these rules is to 
suppose that a one-to-one relationship exists between the elements of language and 
those of thought or knowledge. 
Let me show you this at once in the case of sentences and propositions. Not every 
sentence in a book expresses a proposition. For one thing, some sentences express 
questions. They state problems rather than answers. Propositions are the answers to 
questions. They are declarations of knowL edge or opinion. That is why we call 
sentences which express them declarative, and distinguish sentences which ask 
questions as interrogative. Other sentences express wishes or intentions. They may give 
us some knowledge of the author's purpose, but they do not convey the knowledge he is 
trying to expound. 
Moreover, not all the declarative sentences can be read as if each expressed one 
proposition. There are at least two reasons for this. The first is the fact that words are 
ambiguous and can be used in various senses. Hence it is possible for the same sentence 
to express different propositions if there is a shift in the terms the words express. 
"Reading is learning" is certainly a simple sentence. But if at one place I mean by 
"learning" the acquisition of information, and at another I mean the development of 
understanding, the proposition is not the same, because the terms are different. Yet the 
sentence is verbally the.same. 
The second reason is thafall sentences are not as simple as "reading is learning." You 
may remember from grammar school, if you belonged to a more fortunate generation, 
the distinction between simple sentences, on the one hand, and complex or compound 
sentences, on the other. When its words are used unambiguously, a simple sentence 
usually expresses a single proposition. But even when its words are used 
unambiguously, a compound sentence expresses two or more propositions. A compound 
sentence is really a collection of sentences, connected by such words as "and," or "if" 
and "then," or "not only" and "but also." You may rightly conclude that the line between 

a long compound sentence and a short paragraph may be difficult to draw. A compound 
sentence can express a number of propositions related in the form of an argument. 
Complex sentences are the most difficult to interpret. There is no question that 
compound sentences express several propositions somehow related. But a complex 
sentence may express either one proposition or several. Let me take an interesting 
sentence from Machiavelli's The Prince to show you what I mean: 
A prince ought to inspire fear in such a way mat, if he does not win love, he avoids 
hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will 
always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and from their women. 
That is grammatically a single sentence, though it is both compound and complex. The 
semicolon and the "because" indicate the major break which makes the sentence 
compound. The first proposition is that a prince ought to inspire fear in a certain way. 
Beginning with the word "because," we have a complex sentence. It could be made 
independent by saying: "The reason for this is that he can endure," and so forth. This 
complex sentence expresses two propositions at least: (l) the reason why the prince 
ought to inspire fear in a certain way is that he can endure being feared so long as he is 
not hated; (a) he can avoid being hated only by abstaining from the property of his 
citizens and their women. 
You can see why it is important to distinguish the various propositions that a long 
compound and complex sentence contains. In order to agree or disagree with 
Machiavelli, you must first understand what he is saying. But he is saying three things 
in this one sentence. You may disagree with one of them and agree with the others. You 
may think Machiavelli is wrong in recommending terrorism to a prince on any grounds; 
but you may acknowledge his shrewdness in saying that the prince had better not arouse 
hatred along with fear, and you may also agree that keeping his hands off their property 
and women is an indispensable condition of not being hated. Unless you recognize the 
distinct propositions in a complicated sentence, you cannot make a discriminating 
judgment on what the writer is saying. 
Lawyers know this fact very well. They have to examine sentences carefully to see what 
is being alleged by the plaintiff or denied by the defendant. The single sentence, "John 
Doe signed the lease on March 24," looks simple enough, but still it says several things, 
one of which may be true and the other false. John Doe may have signed the lease, but 
not on March 24, and that fact may be important. In short, even a grammatically simple 
sentence sometimes expresses two or more propositions. 
 - 3 - 
I have said enough to indicate what I mean by the difference between sentences and 
propositions. They are not related as one to one. Not only may a single sentence express 
several propositions, either through ambiguity or complexity, but one and the same 
proposition can be expressed by two or more different sentences. If you grasp my terms 
through the words and phrases I use synonymously, you will know that I am saying the 
same thing when I say, "Teaching and being taught are correlative functions," and 
"Initiating and receiving communication are related processes." 
I am going to stop explaining the grammatical and logical points involved, and turn to 
the rules. The difficulty in this chapter, as in the last, is to stop explaining. Perhaps I had 
better assume that the school you went to taught some grammar. If it did, you may see 

now why all that business of syntax, of parsing and diagramming sentences, was not a 
meaningless routine invented by old-fashioned teachers to crush the spirit of the young. 
It all helps toward skill in writing and reading. 
In fact, I should say it is almost indispensable. You cannot begin to deal with terms, 
propositions, and arguments！ the elements of thought！until you can penetrate 
beneath the surface of language. So long as words, sentences, and paragraphs are 
opaque and unanalyzed, they are a barrier to, rather than a medium of, communication. 
You will read words but not receive knowledge. 
Here are the rules. The first rule, you will recall from the last chapter, is: Find the 
important words and come to terms. The second rule is: Mark the most important 
sentences in a book and discover the propositions they contain. The third rule is: Locate 
or construct the basic arguments in the book by finding them in the connection of 
sentences. You will see later why I did not say "paragraphs" in the formulation of this 
rule. 
You have already been introduced to the second and third rules. In the early chapters, 
we marked the sentence "reading is learning" as important, because it expressed a basic 
proposition in this discussion. We also noted several different kinds of argument: a 
proof that the great books are most readable, and a marshaling of evidence to show that 
the schools have failed to teach the arts of reading and writing. 
Our task now is to get further light on how to operate according to the rules. How does 
one locate the most important sentences in a book? How, then, does one interpret them 
to discover the one or more propositions they contain? 
Again, there is this emphasis on what is important. To say that there is only relatively 
small number of important sentences in a book does not mean that you need pay no 
attention to all the rest. Obviously you have to understand every sentence. But most of 
the sentences, like most of the words, will cause you no difficulty. From your point of 
view as a reader, the sentences important for you are those which require an effort of 
interpretation because, at first sight, they are not perfectly intelligible. You understand 
them just well enough to know there is more to understand. These may not be the 
sentences which are most important for the author, but they are likely to be, because 
you are likely to have the greatest difficulty with the most important things the author 
has to say. 
From the author's point of view, the important sentences are those which express the 
judgments on which his whole argument rests. A book usually contains much more than 
the bare statement of an argument, or a series of arguments. The author may explain 
how he came to the point of view he now holds, or why he thinks his position has 
serious consequences. He may discuss the words he has to use. He may comment on the 
work of others. He may indulge in all sorts of supporting and surrounding discussion. 
But the heart of his communication lies in the major affirmations and denials he is 
making, and the reasons he gives for so doing. To come to grips, therefore, you have to 
see the main sentences as if they were raised from the page in high relief. 
Some authors help you do this. They underline the sentences for you. They either tell 
you that this is an important point when they make it, or they use one or another 
typographical device to make their leading sentences stand out. Of course, nothing helps 
those who will not keep awake while reading. I have met many students who paid no 
attention to such signs. They preferred to read on rather than Stop and examine the 
important sentences carefully. They somehow knew unconsciously that the author was 

not just being helpful. He was trying to get them to do some mental work where it was 
most needed. 
There are a few books in which the leading propositions are set forth in sentences which 
occupy a special place in the order and style of the exposition. Euclid, again, gives us 
the. most obvious example of this. He not only states his definitions, his postulates, and 
axioms！his principal propositions！at the beginning, but he labels every proposition to 
be proved. You may not understand his statements. You may not follow his arguments. 
But, if you have eyes in ' your head, you cannot miss the important sentences or the 
grouping of sentences for the statement of the proofs. That is^all done for you. 
The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas is another book whose style of 
exposition puts the leading sentences into high relief. It proceeds by raising questions. 
Each section is headed by a question. There are many indications of the answer which 
St. Thomas is trying to defend. A whole series of objections opposing the answer is 
stated. The place where St. Thomas begins to argue his point is marked by the words, "I 
answer that." There is no excuse tor not being able to locate the important sentences in 
such a book, those expressing the reasons as well as the conclusions, yet I must report 
that it is all a blur for students who treat everything they read as equally important. That 
usually means that everything is equally unimportant. 
 - 4 - 
Apart from books whose style or format calls attention to what most needs 
interpretation by the reader, the spotting of sentences is a job the reader must perform 
for himself. There are several things he can do. I have already mentioned one. If he is 
sensitive to the difference between passages he can understand readily and those he 
cannot, he will probably be able to locate the sentences which carry the main burden of 
meaning. Perhaps you are beginning to see how essential a part of reading it is to be 
perplexed and know it. Wonder is the beginning of wisdom in learning from books as 
well as from nature. If you never ask yourself any questions about the meaning of a 
passage, you cannot expect the book to give you any insight you do not already possess. 
Another clue to the important sentences is found in the words which compose them. If 
you have already marked the important words, they should lead you to the sentences 
which deserve further attention. Thus the first step in interpretative reading prepares for 
the second. But the reverse may also be the case. It may be that you will mark certain 
words only after you have become puzzled by the meaning of a sentence. The fact that I 
have stated these rules in a fixed order does not mean that you have to follow them in 
that order. Terms constitute propositions. Propositions contain terms. If you know the 
terms the words express, you have caught the proposition in the sentence. If you 
understand the proposition conveyed by a sentence, you have arrived at the terms also. 
This suggests one further clue to the location of the principal propositions. They must 
belong to the main arguments of the book. They must be either premises or conclusions. 
Hence, if you can detect those sentences which seem to form a sequence, a sequence in 
which there is a beginning and an end, you probably have put your finger on sentences 
which are important. 
I said a sequence in which there is a beginning and an end. Every argument which men 
can express in words takes time to state, more obviously so than a single sentence. You 
may speak a sentence in one breath, but there are pauses in an argument. You have to 
say one thing first, then another, and still another. An argument begins somewhere, goes 
somewhere, gets somewhere. It is a movement of thought. It may begin with what is 

really the conclusion and then proceed to give the reasons for it. Or it may start with the 
evidences and reasons and bring you to the conclusion which follows therefrom. 
Of course, here as elsewhere, the clue will not work unless you know how to use it. You 
have to recognize an argument when you see one. Despite some disappointing 
experiences in teaching, I still persist in my opinion that the human mind is as naturally 
sensitive to arguments as the eye is to colors. The eye will not see if it is not kept open, 
and the mind will not follow an argument if it is not awake. I explain my 
disappointment with students in this connection by saying that they are mostly asleep 
while they read a book or listen to what goes on in class. 
Several years ago, Mr. Hutchins and I began to read some books with a new group of 
students. They had had almost no training in reading and had read very little when we 
first met them. One of the first books we read was Lucretius' account of The Nature of 
Things. We thought this would be interesting for them. Most of our students are extreme 
materialists to begin with. And this work by Lucretius is a powerful exposition of the 
extreme materialistic position. It is the most extensive statement we have of the position 
of the ancient Greek atomists. 
Because they were beginners in reading (though most of them were college juniors and 
seniors), we read the book slowly, at the rate of about thirty pages a time. Even so, they 
had difficulty in knowing what words to mark, what sentences to underline. Everything 
Lucretius said seemed to them of equal importance. Mr. Hutchins decided that it would 
be a good exercise for them to write out just the conclusions which Lucretius reached or 
tried to prove in the next part. "Don't tell us," he said, "what Lucretius thinks about the 
gods or women, or what you think about Lucretius. We want the argument in a nutshell, 
and that means finding the conclusions first." 
The main argument in the section they had to read was an attempt to show that the 
atoms differ only in shape, size, weight, and speed of motion. They have no qualities at 
all, no colors or smells or textures. All the qualities we experience are entirely 
subjective！in us rather than in things. 
The conclusions could have been written down in a few propositions. But they brought 
in statements of every sort. Their failure to extract conclusions from everything else was 
not due to lack of training in logic. They had no difficulty in following the line of an 
argument once it was presented to them. But they had to have the argument lifted out of 
the text for them. They were not good enough readers yet to do that for themselves. 
When Mr. Hutchins did the job, they saw how the statements written on the board 
formed an argument. They could see the difference between the premises！the reasons 
or evidences！and the conclusions they supported. In short, they had to be taught how 
to read, not how to reason. 
I repeat, we did not have to teach them logic or explain in detail what an argument was. 
They could recognize one as soon as it was put on the board in a few simple statements. 
But they could not find arguments in a book because they had not yet learned to read 
actively, to disengage the important sentences from all the rest, and to observe the 
connections the author made. Reading Lucretius as they read the newspaper, they 
naturally did not make such discriminations. 
 - 5 - 
Now let us suppose that you have located the leading sentences. Another step is 
required by the rule. You must discover the proposition or propositions each of these 

sentences contains. This is just another way of saying that you must know what the 
sentence means. You discover terms by discovering what a word means in a given 
usage. You discover propositions similarly by interpreting all the words that make up 
the sentence, and especially its principal words. 
Obviously, you cannot do this unless you know a little-grammar. You must know the 
role which adjectives and adverbs play, how verbs function in relation to nouns, how 
modifying words and clauses restrict or amplify the meaning of the words they modify, 
and so forth. You must be able to dissect a sentence according to the rules of syntax. I 
said before that I was going to assume you knew this much grammar. I cannot believe 
you do not, though you may have grown a little rusty from lack of practice in the 
rudiments of the art of reading. 
There are only two differences between finding the terms which words express and the 
propositions in sentences. One is that you employ a larger context in the latter case. You 
bring all the surrounding sentences to bear on the sentence in question, just as you used 
the surrounding words to interpret a particular word. In both cases, you proceed from 
what you do understand to the gradual elucidation of what is at first relatively 
unintelligible. 
The other difference lies in the fact that complicated sentences usually express two or 
more propositions. You have not completed your interpretation of an important sentence 
until you have separated out of it all the different, though perhaps related, propositions it 
contains. Skill in doing this is easily exercised. Take some of the complicated sentences 
in this book and try to state in your own words each of the things that is being asserted. 
Number them and relate them. 
"State in your own words!" That suggests the best test I know for telling whether you 
have understood the proposition or propositions in the sentence. If, when you are asked 
to explain what the author means by a particular sentence, all you can do is to repeat his 
very words, with some minor alterations in order, you had better suspect that you do not 
know what he means. Ideally, you should be able to say the same thing in totally 
different words. The ideal can, of course, be approximated in degrees. But if you cannot 
get away at all from the author's words, it shows that only words have passed from him 
to you, not thought or knowledge. You know his words, not his mind. He was trying to 
communicate knowledge, and all you received were words. 
The process of translation from a foreign language into English is relevant to the test I 
have suggested. If you cannot state in an English sentence what a French sentence says, 
you know you do not understand the meaning of the French. Such translation is entirely 
on the verbal level, because even when you have formed a faithful English replica, you 
still may not know what the writer of the French sentence was trying to convey. I have 
read a lot of translations which reveal such ignorance. 
The translation of one English sentence into another, however, is not merely verbal. The 
new sentence you have formed is not a verbal replica of the original. If accurate, it is 
faithful to the thought alone. That is why the making of such translations is the best test 
you can apply to yourself, if you want to be sure you have caught the proposition, not 
merely swallowed the words. I have tried it countless times on students. It never fails to 
detect the counterfeit of understanding. The student who says he knows what the author 
means, but can only repeat the author's sentence to show that he does, would not be able 
to recognize the author's proposition if it were presented to him in other words. 

The author may himself express the same proposition in different words in the course of 
his writing. The reader who has not seen through the words to the proposition they 
convey is likely to treat the equivalent sentences as if they were statements of different 
propositions. Imagine a person who did not know that "24-2== 4" and "4 ！ 2 = 2" were 
different notations for the same arithmetic relationship！ the relationship of four as the 
double of two, or two as the half of four. 
You would have to conclude that that person simply did not understand the equation. 
The same conclusion is forced on you concerning yourself or anybody else who cannot 
tell when equivalent statements of the same proposition are being made, or who cannot 
himself offer an equivalent statement when he claims to understand the proposition a 
sentence contains. 
These remarks have a bearing on the problem of reading two books about the same 
subject matter. Different authors frequently say the same thing in different words, or 
different things using almost the same words. The reader who cannot see through the 
language to the terms and propositions will never be able to compare such related 
works. Because of their verbal differences, he is likely to misread the authors as 
disagreeing, or to ignore their real differences because of verbal resemblances in their 
statements. I would go further and say that a person who cannot read two related books 
in a discriminating way cannot read either of them by itself. 
There is one other test of whether you understand the proposition in a sentence you have 
read. Can you point to some experience you have had which the proposition describes 
or to which the proposition is in any way relevant? Can you exemplify the general truth 
which has been enunciated by referring to a particular instance of it? To imagine a 
possible case is often as good as reporting an actual one. If you cannot do anything at all 
to exemplify or illustrate the proposition, either imaginatively or by reference to actual 
experiences, you should suspect that you do not know what is being said. 
All propositions are not equally susceptible to this test. It may be necessary to have the 
special experience which only a laboratory can afford to be sure you have grasped 
certain scientific propositions. We shall return to this point later in the discussion of 
reading scientific books. But here the main point is clear. Propositions do not exist in a 
vacuum. They refer to the world in which we live. Unless you can show some 
acquaintance with actual or possible facts to which the proposition refers or is relevant 
somehow, you are playing with words, not dealing with thought and knowledge. 
Let me give you one illustration. A basic proposition in metaphysics is expressed by the 
following words: "Nothing acts except what is actual." I have had many students repeat 
these words to me with an air of satisfied wisdom. They have thought they were 
discharging their duty to me and to the author by so perfect a verbal repetition. But the 
sham was too obvious, I would first ask them to state the proposition in other words. 
Seldom could they say, tor instance, that if something does not exist, it cannot do 
anything. Yet this is an immediately apparent translation！apparent, at least, to anyone 
who understood the proposition in the original sentence. 
Failing to get a translation, I would then ask tor an exemplification of the proposition. If 
any one of them told me that people do not run away from what is merely possible ！
that a baseball game is not postponed on account of possible showers！I would know at 
once that the proposition had been grasped. 
The vice of "verbalism" can be defined as the bad habit of using words without regard 
for the thoughts they should convey and without awareness of the experiences to which 

they should refer. It is playing with words. As the two tests I have just suggested 
indicate, "verbalism" is the besetting sin of those who fail to read interpretatively. Such 
readers never get beyond the words. They possess what they read as a verbal memory 
which they can recite emptily. Strangely enough, one of the charges made by 
progressive educators against the liberal arts is that they tend to verbalism, when the 
facts clearly show that it is progressive education's neglect of the three R's which does 
exactly that. The failure in reading！the vicious verbalism！of those who have not been 
trained in the arts of grammar and logic shows how lack of such discipline results in 
slavery to words rather than mastery of them. 
 - 6 - 
We have spent enough time on propositions. Let us now turn to the third rule, which 
requires the reader to deal with collections of sentences. I said before that there was a 
reason for not formulating this third rule by saying that the reader should find the most 
important paragraphs. The reason is that there are no settled conventions among writers 
about how to construct paragraphs. Some great writers, such as Montaigne and Locke, 
write extremely long paragraphs; 
others, such as Machiavelli and Hobbes, write relatively short ones. In recent times, 
under the influence of newspaper and magazine style, most writers tend to cut their 
paragraphs to fit quick and easy reading. I must confess to you that in the course of 
writing this book I have often made two para' graphs out of what seemed to me to be 
naturally one, because I have been told that most readers like short paragraphs. This 
paragraph, for instance, is probably too long. If I had wanted to coddle my readers, I 
should have started a new one with the words, "Some great writers." 
It is not merely a matter of length. The point that is troublesome here has to do with the 
relation between language and thought. The logical unit to which the third rule directs 
our attention is the argument！a sequence of propositions, some of which give reasons 
for another. This logical unit is not uniquely related to any recognizable unit of writing, 
as terms are related to words and phrases, and propositions to sentences. An argument, 
as we have seen, may be expressed in a single complicated sentence. Or it may be 
expressed in a number of sentences that are only part of one paragraph. Sometimes an 
argument may coincide with a paragraph, but it may also happen that an argument runs 
through several paragraphs. 
There is one further difficulty. There are many paragraphs in any book which do not 
express an argument at all！perhaps not even part of one. They may consist of 
collections of sentences that detail evidence or report how the evidence has been 
gathered. As there are sentences that are of secondary importance, because they are 
merely digressions or side remarks, so also can there be paragraphs of this sort. 
Because of all this, I suggest the following rule: Find if you can the paragraphs in a 
book which state its important arguments; but if the arguments are not thus expressed, 
your task is to construct thsm, by taking a sentence from this paragraph, and one from 
that, until you have gathered together the sequence of sentences which state the 
propositions that compose the argument. 
After you have discovered the leading sentences, the construction of paragraphs should 
be relatively easy. There are various ways of doing this. You can do it by actually 
writing out on a pad the propositions that together form an argument. Or you can put a 
number in the margin to indicate the place where the sentences occur that should be tied 
together in a sequence. 

Authors are more or less helpful to their readers in this matter of making the arguments 
plain. Good authors try to reveal, not conceal, their thought. Yet not even all good 
authors do this in the same way. Some, such as Euclid, Galileo, Newton (authors who 
write in a geometrical or mathematical style), come close to the ideal of making a single 
paragraph an argumentative unit. With the exception of Euclid, there are almost none 
who make every paragraph an argument. The style of most writing in non-mathematical 
fields of science tends to present two or more arguments in a single paragraph or to have 
an argument run through several. 
In proportion as a book is more loosely constructed, the paragraphs tend to become 
more diffuse. You often have to search through all the paragraphs of a chapter to find 
the sentences you can construct into the statement of a single argument. I have read 
some books which make you search in vain, and some which do not even encourage the 
search. 
A good book usually summarizes itself as its arguments develop. If the author 
summarizes his arguments for you at the end of a chapter, or at the end of an elaborate 
section, you should be able to look back over the preceding pages and find the materials 
he has brought together in the summary. In The Origin of Species, Darwin summarizes 
his whole argument for the reader in a last chapter, entitled "Recapitulation and 
Conclusion." The reader who has worked through the book deserves that help. The one 
who has not, cannot use it. 
Another difference between a good and a bad writer is the omission of steps in an 
argument. Sometimes they can be omitted without damage or inconvenience, because 
the propositions left out can be generally supplied from the common knowledge of 
readers. But sometimes their omission is misleading, and may even be intended to 
mislead. One of the most familiar tricks of the orator or propagandist is to leave certain 
things unsaid, things which are highly relevant to the argument, but which might be 
challenged if made explicit. While we do not expect such devices in an honest author 
whose aim is to instruct us, it is nevertheless a sound maxim of careful reading to make 
every step in an argument explicit. 
Whatever kind of book it is, your obligation as a reader remains the same. If the book 
contains arguments, you must know what they are, and in a nutshell. Any good 
argument can be put into a nutshell. There are, of course, arguments built upon 
arguments. In the course of an elaborate analysis, one thing may be proved in order to 
prove another, and this may be used in turn to make a still further point. The units of 
reasoning, however, are single arguments. If you can find these in any book you are 
reading, you are not likely to miss the larger sequences. 
This is all very well to say, you may object, but unless one knows the structure of 
argument as a logician does, how can one be expected to find them in a book, or worse, 
to construct them when the author doesn't state them com-pactly in a single paragraph? 
I can answer you by pointing out why it must be obvious that you do not have to know 
about arguments "as a logician does." There are relatively few logicians in the world, 
for better or for worse. Most of the books which convey knowledge and can instruct us 
contain arguments. They are intended for the general reader, not tor the specialists in 
logic. 
I, for one, do not believe that great logical competence is needed to read these books. I 
repeat what I said before, that the nature of the human mind is such that if it works at all 

during the process of reading, if it comes to terms with the author and reaches his 
propositions, it will see his arguments as well. 
There are, however, a few things I can say which may be helpful to you in carrying out 
this third rule. In the first place, remember that every argument must involve a number 
of statements. Of these, some give the reasons why you should accept a conclusion the 
author is proposing. It you find the conclusion first, then look for the reasons. If you 
find the reasons first, see what they lead to. 
In the second place, discriminate between the kind of argument which points to one or 
more particular facts as evidence for some generalization and the kind which offers a 
series of general statements to prove some further generalization. General propositions 
which are called self-evident, or axioms, are propositions we know to be true as soon as 
we understand their terms. Such propositions are ultimately derived from our experience 
of particulars. 
For example, when you understand what any physical whole is, and when you 
understand what it means for anything to be a part of such a whole, you know at once 
that the whole is greater than any of its parts. Through understanding three terms！
whole, part, and greater than！you at once know a true proposition. The most important 
step in getting to that truth is restricting the meaning of the word "whole" by the 
qualification physical. The proposition that the whole is greater than a part is not true 
for every sort of whole. But when you use these words with restricted meanings, you 
reach terms which are evidently related in a certain way. What becomes evident in this 
way is a familiar axiom, a proposition which men have commonly recognized to be true 
for many centuries. 
Sometimes such propositions are called tautologies. The name makes very little 
difference except to indicate how you feel about the proposition whose truth is clear 
without proof！a generalization which is argued directly from particulars. When in 
modern times self-evident truths have been called "tautologies," the feeling behind it is 
sometimes one of contempt for the trivial, or a suspicion of legerdemain. Rabbits are 
being pulled out of the hat. You put the truth in by defining your words, and then pull it 
out as if you were surprised to find it there. Notice, however, that that is not the case. To 
restrict the meaning of a word is not to define a thing. Wholes and parts are things, not 
words. We did not define them. In fact, we cannot. What we did do was to limit our 
words so that they referred to a certain type of thing with which we are acquainted. 
Once that was done we found we knew something that our restricted words could 
express. 
In the literature of science, the distinction is observed between the proof of a 
proposition by reasoning and its establishment by experiment. Galileo, in his Two New 
Sciences, speaks of illustrating by experiment conclusions which had already been 
reached by mathematical demonstration. And in a concluding chapter, the great 
physiologist Harvey writes: "It has been shown by reason and experiment that blood by 
the beat of the ventricles flows through the lungs and heart and is pumped to the whole 
body." Sometimes it is possible to support a proposition both by reasoning from other 
general truths and by offering experimental evidence. Sometimes only one method of 
argument is available. 
In the third place, observe what things the author says he must assume, what he says can 
be proved or otherwise evidenced, and what need not be proved because it is self-
evident. He may honestly try to tell you what all his assumptions are, or he may just as 
honestly leave you to find them out for yourself. Obviously, everything cannot be 

proved, just as everything cannot be defined. If every proposition had to be proved, 
there would be no beginning to any proof. Such things as axioms, or propositions 
somehow drawn directly from experience, and assumptions, or postulates, are needed 
for the proof of other propositions. If these others are proved, they can, of course, be 
used as premises in further proofs. 
 - 7 - 
These three rules of reading！about terms, propositions, and arguments！can be 
brought to a head in a fourth and final rule. This fourth rule governs the last step in the 
second reading of a book. More than that, it ties the second reading together with the 
first. 
You may remember that the last step in the first reading was the discovery of the major 
problems which the author tried to answer in the course of his book. Now, after you 
have come to terms with him and grasped his propositions and arguments, you can 
check what you have found by answering the following questions. Which of the 
problems that the author tried to solve did he succeed in solving? In the course of 
solving these, did he get into any new ones? Of the problems he failed to solve, old or 
new, which did the author himself know he failed on? A good writer, like a good reader, 
should know whether a problem 'has been solved or not, though I can see how it might 
cost the reader less pain to acknowledge the failure. 
When you are able to answer these questions, you can feel reasonably assured that you 
have managed to understand the book. If you started with a book that was above you！
and one, therefore, that was able to teach you something！you have come a long way. 
More than that, you are now able to complete your reading of the book. 
The third and last stage of the job will be relatively easy. You have been keeping your 
eyes and mind open and your mouth shut. Up to this point, you have been following the 
author. From this point on, you are going to get a chance to argue with the author and 
express yourself. 
 CHAPTER TWELVE 
The Etiquette of Talking Back 
 - 1 - 
and where are we now? 
I said at the end of the last chapter that we have come a long way. We have learned 
what is required of us in the first reading of a book. That is the reading in which we 
analyze the book's structure. We have also learned four rules for doing a second reading 
of the same book！an interpretative reading. The four rules are: (i) come to terms with 
an author by interpreting his basic words; (2) grasp the author's leading propositions 
through finding his important sentences; (3) know the author's arguments by finding 
them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences; (4) determine which of his 
problems the author solved and which he did not, and, of the latter, decide which the 
author knew he failed to solve. 
You are now ready for the third way of reading the same book. Here you will reap the 
reward of all your previous efforts. 

Reading a book is a kind of conversation. You may think it is not conversation at all, 
because the author does all the talking and you have nothing to say. If you think that, 
you do not realize your opportunities and obligations as a reader. 
As a matter of fact, the reader has the last word. The author has had his say, and then it 
is the reader's turn. The conversation between a book and its reader would appear to be 
an orderly one, each party talking in turn, no interruptions, and so forth. If, however, the 
reader is undisciplined and impolite, it may be anything but orderly. The poor author 
cannot defend himself. He cannot say, "Here, wait till I've finished, before you start 
disagreeing." He cannot protest that the reader has missed his point. 
Ordinary conversations between persons who confront each other are good only when 
they are carried on decently. I am not thinking merely of the decencies according to 
conventions of social politeness. There is, in addition, an intellectual etiquette one 
should observe. Without it, conversation is bickering rather than profitable 
communication. I am assuming here, of course, that the conversation is about a serious 
matter on which men can agree or disagree. Then it becomes important that they 
conduct themselves well. Otherwise, there is no profit in the enterprise. The profit in 
good conversation is something learned. 
What is true of ordinary conversation is even more true of the rather special situation in 
which a book has talked to a reader and the reader answers back. That the author is well 
disciplined, we shall take for granted temporarily. That he has conducted his part of the 
conversation well can be assumed in the case of great books. What can the reader do to 
reciprocate? What must he do to hold up his end well? 
The reader has an obligation as well as an opportunity to talk back. The opportunity is 
clear. Nothing can stop a reader from pronouncing judgment. The roots of the 
obligation, however, lie a little deeper in the nature of the relation between books and 
readers. 
If a book is of the sort which conveys knowledge, the author's aim was to instruct. He 
has tried to teach. He has tried to convince or persuade his reader about something. His 
effort is crowned with success only if the reader finally says, "I am taught. You have 
convinced me that such and such is true, or persuaded me that it is probable." But even 
if the reader is not convinced or persuaded, the author's intention and effort should be 
respected. The reader owes him a considered judgment. If he cannot say, "I agree," he 
should at least have grounds for disagreeing or even tor suspending judgment on the 
question. 
I am saying no more than that a good book deserves an active reading. The activity of 
reading does not stop with the work of understanding what a book says. It must be 
completed by the work of criticism, the work of judging. The passive reader sins against 
this requirement, probably even more than against the rules of analysis and interpre. 
tation. He not only makes no effort to understand; he dismisses a book simply by 
putting it down or forgetting it. Worse than faint praise, he damns it by no critical 
consideration whatsoever. 
 - 2 - 
What I mean by talking back, you now can see, is not something apart from reading. It 
is the third way in which a book must be read. There are rules here as in the case of the 
other two readings. Some of these are general maxims of intellectual etiquette. We shall 

deal with them in this chapter. Others are more specific criteria for defining the points 
of criticism. They will be discussed in the next chapter. 
There is a tendency to think that a good book is above the criticism of the average 
reader. The reader and the author are not peers. The author is subject to trill only by a 
jury of his peers. Remember Bacon's recomn-endation to the reader: "Read not to 
contradict and confute; not to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and 
discourse; but to weigh and consider." Sir Walter Scott cast' even more direful 
aspersions on those "who read to doubt or read to scorn." 
There is a certain truth here, as we shall see, but I do not like the aura of impeccability 
with which books are thus surrounded, and the false piety it breeds. Readers may be like 
children, in the sense that great authors can teach them, but that does not mean they 
must not be heard from. I am not sure Cervantes was right in saying, "There i? no book 
so bad but something good may be found in it." I do think, however, that there is no 
book so good that fault cannot be found with it. 
It is true that a book which can enlightel its readers, and is in this sense their better, 
should not be criticized by them until they understand it. When they do, tley have 
elevated themselves almost to peerage with the autror. Now they are fit to exercise the 
rights and privileges of their new position. Unless they exercise their critical faculties 
now, they are doing the author an injustice. He has dote what he could to make them his 
equal. He deserves tiat they act like his peers, that they engage in conversation with 
him, that they talk back. 
As I pointed out before, docility is generally confused with subservience. (We tend to 
forget that ihe word "docile" is derived from the Latin root which means to teach or be 
taught.) A person is wrongly thought to ?e docile if he is passive and pliable. On the 
contrary, docility is the extremely active virtue of being teachable. No one is really 
teachable who does not freely exercise his power of independent judgment. The most 
docile reader is, therefore, the most critical. He is the reader who finally responds to a 
book by the greatest effort to make up his own mind on the matters the author has 
discussed. 
I say "finally" because docility requires that a teacher be fully heard and, more than that, 
understood, before he is judged. I should add also that sheer amount of effort is not an 
adequate criterion of docility. The reader must know how to judge a book, just as he 
must know how to arrive at an understanding of its contents. This third group of rules 
for reading is a guide to the last stage in the disciplined exercise of docility. 
We have everywhere found a certain reciprocity between the art of teaching and the art 
of being taught, between the skill of the author which makes him a considerate writer 
and the skill of the reader which makes him handle a book considerately. We have seen 
how the same principles of grammar and logic underlie rules of good writing as well as 
rules of good reading. The rules we have so far discussed concern the achievement of 
intelligibility on the part of the writer and the achievement of understanding on the part 
of the reader. This last set of rules goes beyond understanding to critical judgment. Here 
is where rhetoric comes in. 
There are, of course, many uses of rhetoric. We usually think of it in connection with 
the orator or propagandist. But in its most general significance, rhetoric is involved in 
every situation in which communication takes place among men. If we are the talkers, 
we wish not only to be understood but to be agreed with in some sense. If our purpose 
in trying to communicate is serious, we wish to convince or persuade！ nwe precisely, 

to convince about theoretical matters and to persuade about matters that ultimately 
affect action or feeling. 
To be equally serious in receiving such communication, one must be not only a 
responsive but a responsible listener. You are responsive to the extent that you follow 
what has been said and note the intention which prompts it. But you also have the 
responsibility of taking a position. When you take it, it is yours, not the author's. To 
regard anyone except yourself as responsible for your judgment is to be a slave, not a 
freeman. 
On the part of the speaker or writer, rhetorical skill is knowing how to Convince or 
persuade. Since this is the ultimate end in view, all the other aspects of communication 
must serve it. Grammatical and logical skill in writing clearly and intelligibly has virtue 
in itself, but it is also a means to an end. Reciprocally, on the part of the reader or 
listener, rhetorical skill is knowing how to react to anyone who tries to convince or 
persuade us. Here, too, grammatical and logical skill, which enables us to understand 
what is being said, prepares the way for a critical reaction. 
 - 3 - 
Thus you see how the three arts of grammar, logic, and rhetoric co-operate in regulating 
the elaborate processes of writing and reading. Skill in the first two readings comes 
from a mastery of grammar and logic. Skill in the third depends on the remaining art. 
The rules of this third reading rest on the principles of rhetoric, conceived in the 
broadest sense. We shall consider them as a code of etiquette to make the reader not 
only polite but effective in talking back. 
You probably also see what the first rule is going to be. It has been intimated several 
times already. It is simply that you must not begin to talk back until you have listened 
carefully and are sure you understand. Not until you are honestly satisfied that you have 
accomplished the first two readings should you feel free to express yourself. When you 
have, you not only can justifiably turn critic, but you should. 
This means that the third reading must always follow the other two in time. You have 
already seen how the first two readings interpenetrate each other. They are separate in 
time only for the beginner, and even he may have to combine them somewhat. 
Certainly, the expert reader can discover the contents of a book by analyzing the whole 
into its parts and, at the same time, constructing the whole out of its elements of thought 
and knowledge, its terms, propositions, and arguments. But the expert no less than the 
beginner must wait until he understands before he is justified in criticizing. 
Let me restate this first rule of critical reading in the following form. You must be able 
to say, with reasonable certainty, "I understand," before you can say any one of the 
following things: "I agree," or "I disagree," or "I suspend Judgment." These three 
remarks exhaust all the critical positions you can take. I hope you have not made the 
error of supposing that to criticize is always to disagree. That is ap unfortunate, popular 
misconception. To agree is just as much an exercise of critical judgment on your part as 
to disagree. You can be just as wrong in agreeing as in disagreeing. To agree without 
understanding is inane. To disagree without understanding is impudent. 
Though it may not be so obvious at first, suspending judgment is also an act of 
criticism. It is taking the position that something has not been shown. You are saying 
that you are not convinced or persuaded one way or the other. 

This rule seems to be such obvious common sense that you may wonder why I have 
bothered to state it so explicitly. I have two reasons. In the first place, many people 
make the error I mentioned above of identifying criticism with disagreement. In the 
second place, though this rule seems obviously sound, my experience has been that few 
people' observe it in practice. Like the golden rule, it elicits more lip service than 
intelligent obedience. 
I have had the experience, shared by all authors, of suffering book reviews by critics 
who did not feel obliged to do the first reading first. The critic too often thinks he does 
not have to be a reader as well as a judge. I have also had the experience of lecturing, 
both in the university and on the public platform, and of having critical questions asked 
which were not based on any understanding of what I had said. (By a "critical question" 
here, I mean that rhetorical device by which someone in the audience tries to show the 
speaker up.) And you may remember an occasion where someone said to a speaker, in 
one breath or at most two, "I don't know what you mean, but I think you're wrong." 
I have gradually learned that there is no point in answering critics of this sort. The only 
polite thing to do is to ask them to state your position tor you, the position they claim to 
be challenging. If they cannot do it satisfactorily, it they cannot repeat what you have 
said in their own words, you know that they do not understand, and you are entirely 
justified in ignoring their criticisms. They are irrelevant, as all criticism must be which 
is not solidly based on understanding. When you find the rare person who shows that he 
understands what you are saying as well as you do, then you can delight in his 
agreement or be seriously disturbed by his dissent. 
In years of reading books with students, I have found this rule more honored in the 
breach than in the observance. Students who plainly do not know what the author is 
saying seem to have no hesitation in setting themselves up as his judges. They not only 
disagree with something they do not understand but, what is equally bad, they often 
agree to a position they cannot express intelligibly in their own way. Their discussion, 
like their reading, is all words, words, words. Where understanding is not present, 
affirmations and denials are equally meaningless and unintelligent. Nor is a position of 
doubt or detachment any more intelligent in a reader who does not know what he is 
suspending judgment atout. 
There are several further points to note concerning the observance of this first rule. If 
you are reading a great book, you ought to hesitate before you say, "I understand." The 
presumption certainly is that you have a lot of work to do before you can make that 
declaration honestly and with assurance. You must, of course, be a judge of yourself in 
this raatter, and that makes the responsibility even more severe. 
To say "I don't understand" is, o♀ course, a critical judg. ment, but only after you have 
tried your hardest does it reflect on the book rather than yourself. If you have done 
everything that can be expected of you and still do not understand, it may be because 
the book is unintelligible. The presumption, however, is in favor of the book, especially 
if it be a great one. In reading great books, failure to understand is usually the reader's 
fault. Hence he is obligated to stay with the task of the first two readings a long time 
before entering on the third. When you say "I don't understand" watch your tone of 
voice. Be sure it concedes the possibility that it may not be the author's fault. 
There are two other conditions under which the rule requires especial care. If you are 
reading only part of a book, it is more difficult to be sure that you understand, and hence 
you should be more hesitant to criticize. And sometimes a book is related to other books 
by the same author, and depends upon them for its full significance. In this situation, 

also, you should be more circumspect about saying "I understand," and slower to raise 
your critical lance. 
The best example of brashness in this last respect is furnished by literary critics who 
have agreed or disagreed with Aristotle's Poetics without realizing that the main 
principles in Aristotle's analysis of poetry depend in part on points made in other of his 
works, his treatises on psychology and logic and metaphysics. They have agreed or 
disagreed without understanding what it is all about. 
The same is true of other writers, such as Plato and Kant, Adam Smith and Karl Marx, 
who have not been able to aay everything they thought or knew in a single work. Those 
who judge Kant's Critique of Pure Reason without. reading his Critique of Practical 
Reason, or Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations without reading his Theory of the Moral 
Sentiments, or The Communist Manifesto without Marx's dos Kapital, are more likely 
than not to be agreeing or disagreeing with something they do not fully understand. 
 - 4 - 
The second general maxim of critical reading is as obvious as the first, but needs 
explicit statement, nevertheless, for the same reason. It is that there is no point in 
winning an argument if you know or suspect you are wrong. Practically, of course, it 
may get you ahead in the world for a short time. But honesty is the better policy in the 
slightly longer run. 
As thus stated, I learned the maxim from Mr. Beards-ley Rumi, at the time he was dean 
of the Social Science Division in Chicago. He formulated it in the light of many sad 
experiences, both in the academic world and out. He has since become a leader in the 
mercantile world, and he still finds it true that many people think a conversation is an 
occasion for personal aggrandizement. They think that winning the argument is what 
matters, not learning the truth. 
He who regards conversation as a battle can win only by being an antagonist, only by 
disagreeing successfully, whether he is right or wrong. The reader who approaches a 
book in this spirit reads it only to find something he can disagree with. For the 
disputatious and contentious, a bone can always be found to pick on. It makes no 
difference whether the bone is really a chip off the other man's shoulder. What is sought 
is a casus belli！like an incident in the Far East or in middle Europe. 
Now in a conversation which a reader has with a book in the privacy of his own study, 
there is nothing to prevent the reader from winning the argument. He can dominate the 
situation. The author is not there to defend himself. If all he wants is the empty 
satisfaction of seeming to show the author up, he can get it readily. He scarcely has to 
read the book through to get it. Glancing at the first few pages will suffice. 
But if he realizes that the only profit in conversation, with live or dead teachers, is what 
one can learn from them, if he realizes that yon win only by gaining knowledge, not by 
knocking the other fellow down, he may see the futility of mere contentiousness. I am 
not saying that a reader should not ultimately disagree and try to show where the author 
is wrong. I am saying only that he should be as prepared to agree as to disagree. 
Whichever he does should be motivated by one consideration alone！the facts and the 
truth about them. 
More than honesty is required here. It goes without saying that a reader should admit a 
point when he sees it. But he also should not feel whipped by having to agree with an 

author, instead of dissenting. If he feels that way, he is chronically disputatious. In the 
light of this second maxim, [ would advise him to go to a psychoanalyst before he tries 
to do much serious reading. 
 - 5 - 
The third maxim is closely related to the second. It states another condition prior to the 
undertaking of criticism. It recommends that you regard disagreements as capable of 
being resolved. Where the second maxim urged you not to disagree disputatiously, this 
one warns you against disagreeing hopelessly. One is hopeless about the fruitfulness of 
discussion if one does not recognize that all rational men can agree. Note that I said 
"can agree." I did not say all rational men do agree. I am saying that even when they do 
not agree, they can. And the point I am trying to make is that disagreement is futile 
agitation unless it is undertaken with the hope that it may lead to the resolution of an 
issue. 
These two facts, that men do disagree and can agree, arise from the complexity of 
human nature. Men are rational animals. Their rationality is the source of their power to 
agree. Their animality, and the imperfections of their reason which it entails, is the 
cause of most of the disagreements that occur. They are creatures of passion and 
prejudice. The language they must use to communicate is an imperfect medium, clouded 
by emotion and colored by interest as well as inadequately transparent tor thought. Yet 
to the extent that men are rational, these obstacles to their understanding one another 
can be overcome. The sort of disagreement which is only apparent, resulting from 
misunderstanding, is certainly curable. 
There is, of course, another sort of disagreement, which is due to inequalities of 
knowledge. The ignorant often foolishly disagree with the learned about matters 
exceeding their knowledge. The more learned, however, have a right to be critical of 
errors made by those who lack relevant knowledge. Disagreements of this sort can also 
be corrected. Inequality in knowledge is always curable by instruction. 
In other words, I am saying that all human disagreements can be resolved by the 
removal of misunderstanding or of ignorance. Both cures are always possible, though 
sometimes difficult. Hence the man who, at any stage of a conversation, disagrees, 
should at least hope to reach agreement in the end. He should be as much prepared to 
have his own mind changed as seek to change the mind of an-' other. He should always 
keep before him the possibility that he misunderstands or that he is ignorant on some 
point. No one who looks upon disagreement as an occasion for teaching another should 
forget that it is also an occasion for being taught. 
But the trouble is that many people regard disagreement as unrelated to either teaching 
or being taught. They think that everything is just a matter of opinion. I have mine. You 
have yours. Our right to our opinions is as inviolable as our right to private property. On 
such a view, communication cannot be profitable if the profit to be gained is an increase 
in knowledge. Conversation is hardly better than a ping-pong game of opposed 
opinions, a game in which no one keeps score, no one wins, and everyone is satisfied 
because he ends up holding the same opinions he started with. 
I cannot take this view. I think that knowledge can be communicated and that discussion 
can result in learning. If knowledge, not opinion, is at stake, then either disagreements 
are apparent only！to be removed by coming to terms and a meeting of minds; or, if 
they are real, then the genuine issues can always be resolved！in the long run, of 
course！by appeals to fact and reason. The maxim of rationality concerning 

disagreements is to be patient for the long run. I am saying, in short, that disagreements 
are arguable matters. And argument is both empty and vicious unless it is undertaken on 
the supposition that there is attainable truth which, when attained by reason in the light 
of all the relevant evidence, resolves the original issues. 
How does this third maxim apply to the conversation between reader and author? It 
deals with the situation in which the reader finds himself disagreeing with something iki 
a book. It requires him first to be sure that the disagreement is not due to 
misunderstanding. Suppose that the reader has been careful to observe the rule that he 
must not begin a critical reading until he understands, and is therefore satisfied that 
there is no misunderstanding here. What then? 
This maxim then requires him to distinguish between knowledge and opinion, and to 
regard an issue concerning knowledge as one which can be resolved. It he pursues the 
matter further he may be instructed by the author on points which will change his mind. 
If that does not happen, he may be justified in his criticism, and, metaphorically at least, 
be able to instruct the author. He can at least hope that were the author alive and 
present, his mind could be changed. 
You may remember something that was said in the previous chapter. If an author does 
not give reasons for his propositions, they can be treated only as expressions of opinion 
on his part. The reader who does not distinguish between the reasoned statement of 
knowledge and the flat expression of opinion is not reading to learn. He is at most 
interested in the author's personality and is using the book as a case history. Such a 
reader will, of course, neither agree nor disagree. He does not judge the book but the 
man. 
If, however, the reader is primarily interested in the book and not the man！it, seeking 
to learn, he looks for knowledge not opinion！he should take his critical obligations 
seriously. The distinction between knowledge and opinion applies to him as well as to 
the author. The reader must do more than make judgments of agreement or 
disagreement. He must give reasons for them. In the former case, of course, it suffices if 
he actively share the author's reasons for the point on which they agree. But when he 
disagrees, he must give his own grounds for doing so. Other' wise, he is treating a 
matter of knowledge as if it were opinion. 
Let me summarize now the three general maxims I have discussed. The three together 
state the conditions of a critical reading and the manner in which the reader should 
proceed to talk back. 
The first requires the reader to complete the task of understanding before rushing in. 
The second adjures him not to be disputatious or contentious. The third asks him to 
view disagreement about matters of knowledge as remediable. It goes further. It 
commands him to give reasons for his disagreements so that issues are not merely stated 
but defined. In that lies all hope for resolution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 
The Things the Reader Can Say 
 - 1 - 
the first thing a reader can say is that he understands or that he does not. In fact, he must 
say he understands, in order to say more. If he does not understand, he should keep his 
peace and go back to work on the first two readings of the book. 
There is one exception to the harshness of the second alternative. "I don't understand" 
may be itself a critical remark. To make it so, the reader must be able to support it. If the 
fault is with the book rather than himself, the readei must locate the sources of trouble. 
He should be able to show that the structure of the book is disorderly, that its parts do 
not hang together, that some of it lacks relevance. Or, perhaps, the author equivocates in 
the use of important words, with a whole train of consequent contusions. To the extent 
that a leader can support his charge that the book is unintelligible, he has no further 
critical obligations. 
Let us suppose, however, that you are reading a good book. That means it is a relatively 
intelligible one. And let us suppose that you are finally able to say, "I understand." If in 
addition to understanding the book, you agree thoroughly with what the author says, the 
work is over. The reading is completely done. You have been enlightened, and 
convinced or persuaded. It is clear that we have additional steps to consider only in the 
case of disagreement or suspended judgment. The former is the more usual case. We 
shall deal mainly with it in this chapter. 
To the extent that authors argue with their readers！ and expect their readers to argue 
back！the good reader must be acquainted with the principles of argument. He must be 
able to carry on polite, as well as intelligent, controversy. That is why there is need for a 
chapter of this sort in a book on reading. Not simply by following an author's arguments, 
but only by meeting them as well, can the reader ultimately reach significant agreement 
or disagreement with his author. 
The meaning of agreement and disagreement deserves a moment's further consideration. 
The reader who comes to terms with an author, and grasps his propositions and 
reasoning, is en rapport with the author's mind. In fact, the whole process of 
interpretation is directed toward a meeting of minds through the medium of language. 
Understanding a book can be described as a kind of agreement between writer and 
reader. They agree about the use of language to express ideas. Because of that 
agreement, the reader is able to see through the author's language to the ideas he is 
trying to express. 
It the reader understands a book, then how can he disagree with it? Critical reading 
demands that he make up his own mind. But his mind and the author's have become as 
one through his success in understanding the book. What mind has he left to make up 
independently? 
There are some people who make the error which causes this apparent difficulty. They 
fail to distinguish between two senses of "agreement." In consequence, they wrongly 
suppose that where there is understanding between men. disagreement is impossible. 
They say that all disagreement is simply due to misunderstanding. 

The error is corrected as soon as we remember that the author is making judgments 
about the world in which we live. He claims to be giving us theoretic knowledge about 
the way things exist and behave, or practical knowledge about what should be done. 
Obviously, he can be either right or wrong. His claim is justified only to the extent that 
he speaks truly, or says what is probable in the light of evidence. Otherwise, his claim is 
unfounded. 
If you say, for instance, that "all men are equal," I may take you to mean that all men 
are equally endowed at birth with intelligence, strength, and other abilities. In the light 
of the tacts as I know them, I disagree with you. I think you are wrong. But suppose I 
have misunderstood you. Suppose you meant by these words that all men should have 
equal political rights. Because I misapprehended your meaning, my disagreement was 
irrelevant. Now suppose the mistake corrected. Two alternatives still remain. I can agree 
or disagree, but now if I disagree, there is a real issue between us. I understand your 
political position but hold a contrary one. 
Issues about matters of fact or policy！issues about the way things are or should be！
are real only when they are based on a common understanding of what is being said. 
Agreement about the use of words is the absolutely indispensable condition for genuine 
agreement or disagreement about the facts being discussed. It is because of, not in spite 
of, your meeting the author's mind through a sound interpretation of his book that you 
are able to make up your own mind as concurring in or dissenting from the position he 
has taken. 
 - 2 - 
Now let us consider the situation in which, having said you understand, you proceed to 
disagree. If you have tried to abide by the maxims stated in the previous chapter, you 
disagree because you think the author can be shown to be wrong on some point. You are 
not simply voicing your prejudice or expressing your emotions. 
What seems to me now like many years ago, I wrote a book called Dialectic. It was my 
first book, and wrong in many ways, but at least It was not as pretentious as its title. It 
was about the art of intelligent conversation, the etiquette of controversy. 
My chief error was in thinking that there are two sides to every question, that is, two 
sides both of which could be equally right. I did not know then how to distinguish 
between knowledge and opinion. Despite this error, I think I rightly suggested three 
conditions which must be satisfied in order for controversy to be well conducted. 
Since men are animals as well as rational, it is necessary to acknowledge the emotions 
you bring to a dispute, or those which arise in the course of it. Otherwise you are likely 
to be giving vent to feelings, not stating reasons. You may even think you have reasons, 
when all you have are strong feelings. 
Furthermore, you must make your own assumptions explicit. You must know what your 
prejudices！that is, your prejudg-menis！are. Otherwise you are not likely to admit that 
your opponent may be equally entitled to different assumptions. Good controversy 
should not be a quarrel about assumptions. If an author, for example, explicitly asks you 
to take something for granted, the fact that the opposite can also be taken for granted 
should not prevent you from honoring his request. If your prejudices lie on the opposite 
side, and if you do not acknowledge them to be prejudices, you cannot give the author's 
case a fair hearing. 

Finally, I suggested that an attempt at impartiality is a good antidote for the blindness 
that is inevitable in partisanship. Controversy without partisanship is, of course, 
impossible. But to be sure that there is more light in it, and less heat, each of the 
disputants should at least try to take the other fellow's point of view. If you have not 
been able to read a book sympathetically, your disagreement with it is probably more 
contentious than judicial. 
I still think that these three conditions are the sine qua non of intelligent and profitable 
conversation. They are obviously applicable to reading, in so far as that is a kind of 
conversation between reader and author. Each of them contains sound advice for readers 
who are willing to respect the decencies of disagreement. 
But I have grown older since I wrote Dialectic. And I am a little less optimistic about 
what can be expected of human beings. I am sorry to say that most of my 
disillusionment arises from a knowledge of my own defects. I have so frequently 
violated all of my own rules about good intellectual manners in controversy. I have so 
often caught myself attacking a book rather than criticizing it, knocking straw men over, 
denouncing where I could not support denials, proclaiming my prejudices, as if mine 
were any better than the author's. 
 - 3 - 
1 am still naive enough, however, to think that conversation and critical reading can be 
well disciplined. Only now, twelve years later, I am going to substitute for the rules of 
Dialectic a set of prescriptions which may be easier to follow. They indicate the four 
ways in which a book can be adversely criticized. My hope is that if a reader confine 
himself to making these points, he will be less likely to indulge in expressions of 
emotion or prejudice. 
The four points can be briefly summarized by conceiving the reader as conversing with 
the author, as talking back. After he has said, "I understand but I disagree," he can make 
the following remarks: (1) "You are uninformed"; (2) "You are misinformed"; (3) "You 
are illogical, your reasoning is not cogent"; (4) "Your analysis is incomplete." 
These may not be exhaustive, though I think they are. In any case, they are certainly the 
principal points a reader who disagrees can make. They are somewhat independent. 
Making one of these remarks does not prevent you from making another. Each and all 
can be made, because the defects they refer to are not mutually exclusive. 
But, I should add, the reader cannot make any of these remarks without being definite 
and precise about the respect in which the author is uninformed or misinformed or 
illogical. A book cannot be uninformed or misinformed about everything. It cannot be 
totally illogical. Furthermore, the reader who makes any of these remarks must not only 
make it definitely, by specifying the respect, but he must always support his point. He 
must give reasons for saying what he does. 
The first three remarks are somewhat different from the fourth, as you will presently 
see. Let us consider each of them briefly, and then turn to the fourth. 
(1) To say that an author is uninformed is to say that he lacks some piece of knowledge 
which is relevant to the problem he is trying to solve. Notice here that unless the 
knowledge, if possessed by the author, would have been relevant, there is no point in 
making this remark. To support the remark, you must be able yourself to state the 

knowledge which the author lacks and show how it is relevant, how it makes a 
difference to his conclusions. 
A few illustrations here must suffice. Darwin lacked the knowledge of genetics which 
the work of Mendel and later experimentalists now provides. His ignorance of the 
mechanism of inheritance is one of the major defects in The Origin of Species. Gibbon 
lacked certain facts which later historical research has shown to have a bearing on the 
fall of Rome. Usually, in science and history, the lack of information is discovered by 
later researches. Improved techniques of observation and prolonged investigation make 
this the way things happen for the most part. But in philosophy, it may happen 
otherwise. There is just as likely to be loss as gain with the passage of time. The 
ancients, for example, clearly distinguished between what men can sense and imagine 
and what they can understand. Yet, in the eighteenth century, David Hume revealed his 
ignorance of this distinction between images and ideas, even though it had been so well 
established by the work of earlier philosophers. 
(2) To say that an author is misinformed is to say that he asserts what is not the case. His 
error here may be due to lack of knowledge, but the error is more than that. Whatever its 
cause, it consists of assertions contrary to fact. The author is proposing as true or more 
probable what is in t'9>ct false or less probable. He is claiming to have knowledge he 
does not possess. This kind of defect should be pointed out, of course, only if it is 
relevant to the author's conclusions. And to support the remark you must be able to 
argue the truth or greater probability of a position contrary to the author's. 
For example, in a political treatise, Spinoza appears to 
say that democracy is a more primitive type of government than monarchy. This is 
contrary to well-ascertained tacts of political history. Spinoza's error in this respect has 
a bearing on his argument. Aristotle was misinformed about the role which the male 
factor played in animal reproduction, and consequently came to unsupportable 
conclusions about the processes of procreation. Thomas Aquinas erro neously supposed 
that the heavenly bodies changed only in position, that they were otherwise unalterable. 
Modern astrophysics corrects this error and thereby improves on ancient and medieval 
astronomy. But here is an error which has limited relevance. Making it does not affect 
St. Thomas's metaphysical account of the nature of all sensible things as composed of 
matter and form. 
These first two points of criticism are somewhat related. Lack of information, as we 
have seen, may be the cause of erroneous assertions. Further, whenever a man is 
misinformed, he is also uninformed of the truth. But it makes a difference whether the 
defect be simply negative or positive as well. Lack of relevant knowledge makes it 
impossible to solve certain problems or support certain conclusions. Erroneous 
suppositions, however, lead to wrong conclusions and untenable solutions. Taken 
together, these two points charge an author with defects in his premises. He needs more 
knowledge than he possesses. His evidences And reasons are not good enough in 
quantity or quality. 
(3) To say that an author is illogical is to say that he has committed a fallacy in 
reasoning. In general, fallacies are of two sorts. There is the non sequitur, which means 
that what is drawn as a conclusion simply does not follow from the reasons offered. And 
there is the occurrence of inconsistency, which means that two things the author has 
tried to say are incompatible. To make either of these criticisms, the reader must be able 
to show the precise respect in which the author's argument lacks cogency. One is 

concerned with this defect only to the extent that the major conclusions are affected by 
it. A book may lack cogency in irrelevant respects. 
It is more difficult to illustrate this third point, because few great books make obvious 
slips in reasoning. When they do occur, they are usually elaborately concealed, and it 
requires a very penetrating reader to discover them. But I can show you a patent fallacy 
which I found in a recent reading of Machiavelli's Prince: 
The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old, are good laws. As there cannot be 
good laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed 
they have good laws. 
Now it simply does not follow from the fact that good laws depend on an adequate 
police force, that where the police force is adequate, the laws will necessarily be good. I 
am ignoring the highly questionable character of the first fact. I am only interested in 
the non sequitur here. It is truer to say that happiness depends on health (than that good 
laws depend on an effective police force), but it does not follow that all who are healthy 
are happy. 
In his Elements of Law, Hobbes argues in one place that all bodies are nothing but 
quantities of matter in motion. The world of bodies, he says, has no qualities 
whatsoever. Then, in another place, he argues that man is himself nothing but a body, or 
a collection of atomic bodies in motion. Yet, admitting the existence of sensory 
qualities！colors, odors, tastes, and so forth！he concludes that they are nothing but the 
motions of atoms in the brain. This conclusion is inconsistent with the position first 
taken, namely, that the world of bodies in motion is without qualities. What is said of all 
bodies in motion must apply to any particular group of them, including the atoms of the 
brain. 
This third point of criticism is related to the other two. An author may, of course, fail to 
draw the conclusions which his evidences or principles imply. Then his reasoning, is 
incomplete. But we are here concerned primarily with the case in which he reasons 
poorly from good grounds. It is interesting, but less important, to discover lack of 
cogency in reasoning from premises that are themselves untrue, or from evidences that 
are inadequate. 
A person who from sound premises reaches a conclusion invalidly is, in a sense, 
misinformed. But it is worth while to distinguish the kind of erroneous statement which 
is due to bad reasoning from the kind previously discussed, due to other defects, 
especially insufficient knowledge of relevant details. 
 - 4 - 
The first three points of criticism, which we have just considered, deal with the 
soundness of the author's statements and reasoning. Let us turn now to the fourth 
adverse remark a reader can make. It deals with the completeness of the author's 
execution of his plan！the adequacy with which he discharges the task he has chosen. 
Before we proceed to this fourth remark, one thing should be observed. Since you have 
said you understand, your failure to support any of these first three remarks obligates 
you to agree with the author as far as he has gone. You have no freedom of will about 
this. It is not your sacred privilege to decide whether you are going to agree or disagree. 

Since you have not been able to show that the author is uninformed, misinformed, or 
illogical on relevant matters, you simply cannot disagree. You must agree. You cannot 
say, as so many students and others do, "I find nothing wrong with your premises, and 
no errors in reasoning, but I don't agree with your conclusions." All you can possibly 
mean by saying something like that is that you do not like the conclusions. You are not 
disagreeing. You are expressing your emotions or prejudices. It you have been 
convinced, you should admit it. (If, despite your failure to support one or more of these 
three critical points, you still honestly feel unconvinced, perhaps you should not have 
said you understood in the first place.) 
The first three remarks are related to the author's terms, propositions, and arguments. 
These are the elements he used to solve the problems which initiated his efforts. The 
fourth remark！that the book is incomplete！bears on the structure of the whole. 
(4) To say that an author's analysis is incomplete is to say that he has not solved all the 
problems he started with, or that he has not made as good a use of his materials as 
possible, that he did not see all their implications and ramifications. or that he has failed 
to make distinctions which are relevant to his undertaking. It is not enough to say that a 
book is incomplete. Anyone can say that of any book. Men are finite, and so are their 
works, every last one. There is no point in making this remark, therefore, unless the 
reader can define the inadequacy precisely, either by his own efforts as a knower or 
through the help of other books. 
Let me illustrate this point briefly. The analysis of types of government in Aristotle's 
Politics is incomplete. Because of the limitations of his time and his erroneous 
acceptance of slavery, Aristotle tails to consider, or for that matter even to conceive, the 
truly democratic constitution which is based on universal manhood suffrage; nor can he 
imagine either representative government or the modern kind of federated state. His 
analysis would have to be extended to apply to these political realities. Euclid's 
Elements of Geometry is an incomplete account because he failed to consider other 
postulates about the relation of parallel lines. Modern geometrical works, making these 
other assumptions, supply the deficiencies. Dewey's How We Think; I pointed out 
earlier, is an incomplete analysis of thinking because it fails to treat the sort of thinking 
which occurs in reading or learning by instruction in addition to the sort which occurs in 
investigation and discovery. To a Christian, believing in personal immortality, 
Aristotle's Ethics is an incomplete account of human happiness because it is limited to 
happiness in this life. 
This fourth point is strictly not a basis tor disagreement. It is critically adverse only to 
the extent that it marks the limitations of the author's achievement. A reader who agrees 
with a book in part！because he finds no reason to make any of the other points of 
adverse criticism！may, nevertheless, suspend judgment on the whole, in the light of 
this fourth point about the book's incompleteness. Suspended judgment on the reader's 
part responds to an author's failure to solve his problems perfectly. 
Related books in the same field can be critically compared by reference to these four 
criteria. One is better than another in proportion as it speaks more truth and makes fewer 
errors. If we are reading for knowledge, that book is best, obviously, which most 
adequately treats a given subject matter. One author may lack information which 
another possesses; one may make erroneous suppositions from which another is tree; 
one may be less cogent than another in reasoning from similar grounds. But the 
protoundest comparison is made with respect to the completeness of the analysis which 
each presents. The measure of such completeness is to be found in the number of valid 
and significant distinctions which the accounts being compared contain. You may see 

now how useful it is to have a grasp of the author's terms. The number of distinct terms 
is correlative with the number of distinctions. 
You may also see how the fourth critical remark ties together the three readings of any 
book. The last step in the first reading is to know the problems which the author is 
trying to solve. The last step in the second reading is to know which of these problems 
the author solved and which he did not. The final step of criticism is the point about 
completeness. It touches the first reading in so far as it considers how adequately the 
author stated his problems, and the second reading in so tar as it measures how 
satisfactorily he solved them. 
 - 5 - 
We have now completed, in a general way, the enumeration and discussion of the rules 
of reading. When you have read a book according to these rules, you have done 
something. I need not tell you. You will feel that way about it yourself. But perhaps I 
should remind you that these rules describe an ideal performance. Few people have ever 
read any book in this ideal manner, and those who have, probably read very few books 
this way. The ideal remains, however, the measure of achievement. You are a good 
reader in the degree to which you approximate it. 
When we speak of someone as "well read," we should have this ideal in mind. Too 
often, I fear, we use that phrase to mean the quantity rather than the quality of reading. 
A person who has read widely but not well deserves to be pitied rather than praised, for 
so much effort has been misguided and profitless. 
The great writers have always been great readers, but that does not mean that they read 
all the books which, in their day, were listed as the great and indispensable ones. In 
many cases, they read fewer books than are now required in some of our better colleges, 
but what they did read, they read well. Because they had mastered these books, they 
became peers with their authors. They were entitled to become authorities in their own 
right. In the natural course of events, a good student frequently becomes a teacher, and 
so, too, a good reader becomes an author. 
My intention here is not to lead you from reading to writing. It is rather to remind you 
that one approaches the ideal of good reading by applying the rules I have described in 
the reading of a single book, and not by trying to become superficially acquainted with a 
large number. There are, of course, many books worth reading well. There is a much 
larger number which should be only scanned and skimmed. To become well read, in 
every sense of the word, one must know how to use whatever skill one possesses with 
discrimination！by reading every book according to its merits. 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
And Still More Rules 
 - 1 - 
saith the Preacher: "Of making many books there is no end, and much study is 
weariness of the flesh." You probably feel that way about the reading of books by now, 
and the rules for doing so. I hasten to say, therefore, that this chapter is not going to 

increase the number of rules you have to worry about. All the basic rules have now been 
stated in general. 
Here I am going to try to be more particular by considering the rules in application to 
different kinds of books. And I shall return briefly to die piublem of extrinsic reading. 
So far we have kept our nose in the book. There are a few points to make about the 
utility of looking outside the book you are reading, in order to read it well. 
Before I undertake either of these matters, it may be helpful to present all the rules in a 
single table, each written in the form of a simple prescription. 
I. The Analysis of a Book's Structure 
1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter. 
2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity. 
3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and analyze these parts as you 
have analyzed the whole. 
4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve. 
II. The Interpretation of a Book's Contents 
1. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his basic words. 
2. Grasp the author's leading propositions through dealing with his most important 
sentences. 
3. Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, 
sequences of sentences. 
4. Determine which of his problems the author solved, and which he did not; and of the 
latter, decide which the author knew he failed to solve. 
III. The Criticism of a Book as a Communication of Knowledge 
A. General Maxims 
1. Do not begin criticism until you have com^"^ pleted analysis and interpretation. (Do 
not .". say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say, "I 
understand.") S. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously. 
3. Respect the difference between knowledge and opinion, by having reasons for any 
critical judgment you make. 
B. Specific Criteria tor Points of Criticism 
1. Show wherein the author is uninformed. 
2. Show wherein the author is misinformed. 
3. Show wherein the author is illogical. 
4. Show wherein the author's analysis or account is incomplete. 
Note: Of these, the first three are criteria for disagreement. Failing in all of these, you 
must agree, in part at least, though you may suspend judgment on the whole, in the light 
of the fourth point. 
 
 
In any art or field of practice, rules have a disappointing way of being too general. The 
more general, of course, the fewer, and that is an advantage. But it is also true that the 
more general, the more remote they are from the intricacies of the actual situation in 
which you try to follow them. 
I have stated rules generally enough to apply to any instructive book. But you cannot 
read a book in general. You read this book or that, and every particular book is of a 
particular sort. It may be a history or a book in mathematics, a political tract or a work 
in natural science. Hence you must have some flexibility and adaptability in following 
these rules. I think you will gradually get the feel of how they work on different kinds of 

books, but I may be able to speed the process somewhat by a few indications of what to 
expect. 
In Chapter Seven we excluded from consideration all belles-lettres！novels, plays, and 
lyrics. I am sure you see now that these rules of reading do not apply to fiction. (There 
is, of course, a parallel set of rules which I shall try to suggest in the following chapter.) 
Then, in Chapter Eight we saw that the basic division of expository books is into the 
practical and the theoretical！books that are concerned with problems of action and 
books that are concerned only with something to be known. I propose now that we 
examine the nature of practical books a little further. 
 - 2 - 
The most important thing about any practical book is that it can never solve the practical 
problems with which it is concerned. A theoretical book can solve its own problems. 
Questions about the nature of something can be answered completely in a book. But a 
practical problem can only be solved by action itself. When your practical problem is 
how to earn a living, a book on how to make friends and influence people cannot solve 
it, though it may suggest things to do. Nothing short of the doing solves the problem. It 
is solved only by earning a living. 
Take this book, for example. It is a practical book. If your interest in it is practical, you 
want to solve the problem of learning to read. You would not regard that problem as 
solved and done away with until you did learn. This book cannot solve the problem for 
you. It can only help. You must actually go through the activity of reading, not merely 
this book, but others. That is what I mean by saying that nothing but action solves 
practical problems, and action occurs only in the world, not in books. 
Every action takes place in a particular situation, alwaya in the here and now and under 
these special circumstances. You cannot act in general. The kind of practical judgment 
which immediately precedes action must be highly particular. It can be expressed in 
words, but it seldom is. It is almost never found in books, because the author of a 
practical book cannot envisage the concrete practical situations in which his readers 
may have to act. Try as he will to be helpful, he cannot give them really concrete 
practical advice. Only another person in exactly the same situation could do that. 
Practical books can, however, state more .or less general rules which apply to a lot of 
particular situations of the same general sort. Whoever tries to use such books must 
apply the rules to particular cases and, therefore, must exercise practical judgment in 
doing so. In other words, the reader himself must add something to the book to make it 
applicable in practice. He must add his knowledge of the particular situation, and his 
judgment of how the rule applies to the case. 
Any book which contains rules！prescriptions, maxims, or any sort of general 
directions！you will readily recognize as a practical book. But a practical book may 
contain more than rules. It may try to state the principles which underlie the rules and 
make them intelligible. For example, in this practical book about reading, I have tried 
here and there to explain the rules by brief expositions of grammatical and logical 
principles. The principles which underlie rules are usually in themselves scientific, that 
is, they are uems of theoretic knowledge. Taken together, they are the theory of the 
thing. Thus, we talk about the theory of bridge building or the theory of bridge whist. 
We mean the theoretical principles which make the rules of good procedure what they 
are. 

Practical books fall into two main groups. Some, like this one and the cookbook and the 
driver's manual, are prima^ rily presentations of rules. Whatever other discussion they 
contain is for the sake of the rules. I know of no great book of this sort. The other kind 
of practical book is primarily concerned with the principles which generate rules. All 
the great books in economics, politics, and morals are of this sort. 
I do not mean that the distinction is sharp and absolute. Both principles and rules may 
be found in the same book. The point is only one of relative emphasis. You will have no 
difficulty in sorting books into these two piles. The book of rules in any field will 
always be immediately recognizable as practical. The book of practical principles may 
look at first like a theoretical book. In a sense it is, as we have seen. It deals with the 
theory of a particular kind of practice. You can always tell it is practical, however. The 
nature of its problems gives it away. It is always about a field of human behavior in 
which men can do better or worse. 
In reading a book which is primarily a rulebook, the major propositions to look for, of 
course, are the rules. A rule is most directly expressed by an imperative rather than a 
declarative sentence. It is a command. It says: "Save nine, by taking a stitch in time." It 
can also be expressed declara-tively, as when we say, "A stitch in time saves nine." 
Both forms of statement suggest！the imperative a little mor< emphatically！that it is 
worth while to be prompt in ordei to save nine stitches. 
Whether it is stated declaratively or in the form of direct command, you can always 
recognize a rule because it recom' mends something as worth doing to gain a certain 
end. Thus, the rule of reading which commands you to come to terms can also be stated 
as a recommendation: good reading involves coming to terms. The word "good" is the 
giveaway here. That such reading is worth doing is implied. 
The arguments in a practical book of this sort will be attempts to show you that the rules 
are sound. The writer may have to appeal to principles to persuade you that they are, or 
he may simply illustrate their soundness by showing you how they work in concrete 
cases. Look for both sorts of arguments. The appeal to principles is usually less 
persuasive, but it has one advantage. It can explain the reason for the rules better than 
examples of their use can. 
In the other kind of practical book, dealing mainly with the principles underlying rules, 
the major propositions and arguments will, of course, look exactly like those in a purely 
theoretical book. The propositions will say that something is the case, and the 
arguments will try to show that it is so. 
But there is an important difference between reading such a book and a purely 
theoretical one. Since the ultimate problems to be solved are practical！problems of 
action！ an intelligent reader of such books about "practical principles" always reads 
between the lines or in the margins. He tries to see the rules which may not be expressed 
but can, nevertheless, be derived from the principles. He may go even further. He may 
try to figure out how the rules should be applied in practice. 
Unless it is so read, a practical book is not read as practical. To fail to read a practical 
book as practical is to read it poorly. You really do not understand it, and you certainly 
cannot criticize it properly in any other way. If the intelligibility of rules is to be found 
in principles, it is no less true that the significance of practical principles is to be.found 
in the rules they lead to, the actions they recommend. 

This indicates what you must do to understand either sort of practical book. It also 
indicates the ultimate criteria for critical judgment. In the case of purely theoretical 
books, the criteria for agreement or disagreement relate to the truth of what is being 
said. But practical truth is different from theoretic truth. A rule of conduct is practically 
true on two conditions: one is that it works; the other is that its working leads you to the 
right end, an end you rightly desire. 
Suppose that the end which an author thinks you should seek does not seem like the 
right oiie to you. Even though his recommendations may be practically sound, in the 
sense of getting you to that end, you will not agree with him ultimately. And your 
judgment of his book as practically true or false will be made accordingly. If you do not 
think careful and intelligent reading is worth doing, this book has little practical truth 
for you, however sound my rules may be. 
Notice what this means. In judging a theoretic book, the reader must observe the 
identity of, or the discrepancy between, his own basic principles or assumptions and 
those of the author. In judging a practical book, everything turns on the ends or goals. If 
you do not share Karl Marx's fervor about economic justice, his economic doctrine and 
the reforms it suggests are likely to seem practically false or irrelevant. You may think 
that preserving the status quo is a more desirable objective than removing the iniquities 
of capital' ism. In that case, you are likely to think that revolutionary documents are 
preposterously false. Your main judgment will always be in terms of the ends, not the 
means. We have no practical interest in even the soundest means to reach ends we do 
not care about. 
 - 3 - 
This brief discussion gives you a clue to the two major questions you must ask yourself 
in reading any sort of practical book. The first is: What are the author's objectives? The 
second is: What means is he proposing? It may be more difficult to answer these 
questions in the case of a book about principles than in the case of one about rules. The 
ends and means are likely to be less obvious. Yet answering them in either case is 
necessary for the understanding and criticism of a practical book. 
It also reminds you of one aspect of practical writing we noted earlier. There is an 
admixture of oratory or propaganda in every practical book. I have never read a political 
book！however theoretical it may appear, however "abstract" the principles with which 
it deals！that did not try to persuade the reader about "the best form of government." 
Similarly, moral treatises try to persuade the reader about "the good life" as well as 
recommend ways of leading it. 
You can see why the practical author must always be something of an orator or 
propagandist. Since your ultimate judgment of his work is going to turn on your 
acceptance of the goal tor which he is proposing means, it is up to him to win you to his 
ends. To do this, he has to argue in a way that appeals to your heart as well as your 
mind. He may have to play on your emotions and gain direction of your will. That is 
why I call him an orator or propagandist. 
There is nothing wrong or vicious about this. It is of the very nature of practical affairs 
that men have to be persuaded to think and act in a certain way. Neither practical 
thinking nor action is an affair of the mind alone. The guts cannot be left out. No one 
makes serious practical judgments or engages in action without being moved somehow 
from below the neck. The writer of practical books who does not realize this will be 

ineffective. The reader of them who does not is likely to be sold a bill of goods without 
his knowing it. 
The best protection against propaganda of any sort is the complete recognition of it for 
what it is. Only hidden and undetected oratory is insidious. What reaches the heart 
without going through the mind is likely to bounce back and put the mind out of 
business. Propaganda taken in that way is like a drug you do not know you are 
swallowing. The effect is mysterious. You do not know afterwards why you feel or 
think the way you do. But putting alcohol in your drink in a recognized dosage can give 
you a lift you need and know-how to use. 
The person who reads a practical book intelligently, who knows its basic terms, 
propositions, and arguments, will always be able to detect its oratory. He will spot the 
passages which make an "emotive use of words." Aware that he must be subject to 
persuasion, he can do something about weighing the appeals. He has sales resistance. 
But do not make the error of supposing that sales resistance must be one hundred per 
cent. It is good when it prevents you from buying hastily and thoughtlessly. But it 
should not withdraw you from the market entirely. The reader who supposes he should 
be totally deaf to all appeals imght just as well not read practical books. 
There is one further point here. Because of the nature of practical problems and because 
of the admixture of oratory in all practical writing, the "personality" of the author is 
aiore important in the case of practical books than theoretical. Both in order to 
understand and to judge a moral treatise, a political tract, or an economic discussion, 
you should know something about the character of the writer, something about his life 
and times. In reading Aristotle's Politics, it is highly relevant to know that Greek society 
was based on slavery. Similarly, much light is thrown on The Prince by knowing the 
Italian situation at the time of Machiavelli, and his relation to the Medicis; or, in the 
case of Hobbes' Leviathan, to know that Hobbes lived during the English civil wars and 
was pathologically distressed by social violence and disorder. 
Sometimes the author tells you about himself, his life, and times. Usually he does not do 
so explicitly, and when he does, his deliberate revelation of himself is seldom adequate 
or dependable. Hence reading his book and nothing else may not suffice. To understand 
it and to judge it, you may have to read other books, books about him and his times, or 
books which he himself read and reacted to. 
Any aid to reading which lies outside the book being read is extrinsic. You may 
remember that I distinguished between intrinsic rules and extrinsic aids in Chapter 
Seven. Well, the reading of other books is one of the most obvious extrinsic aids in 
reading a particular book. Let me call this aid "extrinsic reading." I can summarize my 
point here simply by saying that extrinsic reading about the author is much more 
important for interpreting and criticizing practical books than theoretical ones. 
Remember this as an additional rule to guide you in reading practical books. 
 - 4 - 
Now let us turn to the large class of theoretic books and see if there are any additional 
rules there. I must break this large class up into three major divisions, which I have 
already named and discussed in Chapter Eight: history, science, and philosophy. In 
order to deal briefly with a complicated matter, I shall discuss only two things in 
connection with each of these types of books. I shall first consider whatever is peculiar 
to the problems of that type of book-its terms, propositions, and arguments！and then 
discuss whatever extrinsic aids are relevant. 

You already know the point about a history book being a combination of knowledge and 
poetry. All of the great historical works are narratives. They tell a story. Any story must 
have a plot and characters. It must have episodes, complications of action, a climax, and 
an aftermath. These are the elements of a history, viewed as a narrative！not terms, 
propositions, and arguments. To understand a history in its poetic aspect, therefore, you 
must know how to read fiction. I have not yet discussed the rules for doing that, but 
most people can do this sort of reading with some skill anyway. They know how to 
follow a story. They also know the difference between a good and a bad story. History 
may be stranger than fiction, but the historian has to make what happened appear 
plausible, nevertheless. If he does not, he tells a bad story, a dull one, or even a 
preposterous one. 
I shall discuss in the next chapter the rules for reading fiction. Such rules may help you 
to interpret and criticize .histories in their poetic dimension as narratives. Here I shall 
confine myself to the logical rules we have already discussed. Applied to histories, they 
require you to distinguish two kinds of statement you will find. In the first place, there 
are all the propositions about particular things-events, persons, or institutions. These 
are, in a sense, the matter of the history, the substance of what is being narrated. In so 
far as such statements are subject to argument, the author may try to give you, in his text 
or footnotes, the evidences for believing that things happened this way rather than 
otherwise. 
In the second place, the historian may have some general interpretation of the facts he is 
narrating. This may be expressed poetically in the way he tells the story！whom he 
makes the hero, where he places the climax, how he develops the aftermath. But it may 
also be expressed in certain generalizations he enunciates. You must look for general 
propositions of this sort. Herodotus, in his history of the Persian wars, tells you early 
what his major insight is. 
The cities which were formerly great, have most of them become insignificant; and such 
as are at present powerful, were weak in olden time. I shall therefore discourse equally 
of both, convinced that prosperity never continues long in one place. 
I have italicized the generalization which Herodotus exemplifies again and again in the 
course of his story. He does not try to prove the proposition. He is satisfied with 
showing you countless instances in which it appears to be true. That is usually the way 
historians argue for their generalizations. 
There are some historians who try to argue for their general insights about the course of 
human affairs. The Marxist historian not only writes in such a way that the class 
struggle is always clearly exemplified; he frequently argues that this must be the case in 
terms of his "theory of history." He tries to show that the economic interpretation is the 
only one. Another historian, such as Carlyle, tries to show that human affairs are 
controlled by the action of leaders. This is the "great man" theory of history. 
To read a history critically, therefore, you must discovel the interpretation a writer 
places on the facts. You must know his "theory," which means his generalizations and, 
if possible, the reasons for them. In no other way can you tell why certain facts are 
selected and others omitted, why stress is placed on this and not on that. The easiest way 
to catch on is to read two histories of the same thing, written from different points of 
view. (One of the things which distinguishes history from science is that there can be 
two or more good histories of the same events！sharply divergent though equally 
persuasive and creditable. Of a given matter, there is at any time only one good 
scientific account.) 

Extrinsic reading is thus an aid to understanding and judging history books. You may go 
to other histories, or to reference books, to check on the facts. You may even get 
interested enough to look into the original documents from which the historian gathered 
evidence. Reading other books is not the only extrinsic aid to understanding a history. 
You can also visit the places where things happened, or look at monuments and other 
relics of the past. The experience of walking around the battlefield at Gettysburg made 
me realize how much better I should understand the account of Hannibal's invasion had 
I ever crossed the Alps on the back of an elephant. 
I want to stress the reading of other great histories of the same events as the best way to 
get a line on the bias of a great historian. But there is often more than bias in a history. 
There is propaganda. A history of something remote in time or place is also often a tract 
or diatribe for the home folks, as was Tacitus' account of the Germans, and Gibbon's 
explanation of why Rome fell. Tacitus exaggerated the primitive virtues of the Teutonic 
tribes to shame the decadence and effeminacy of his fellow Romans. Gibbon stressed 
the part a rising Christianity had played in a falling Rome to support the freethinkers 
and anticlericals of his day against the established churchmen. 
Of all theoretical books, a history is most like practical books in this respect. Therefore, 
the advice to a reader is the same. Find out something about the character of the 
historian, and the local conditions which may have motivated him. Facts of this sort will 
not only explain his bias but prepare you for the moral lessons he tells you history 
teaches. 
 - 5 - 
The additional rules for reading scientific works are the easiest to state. By a scientific 
work, I mean the report of findings or conclusions in some field of research, whether 
carried on experimentally in a laboratory or by observations of nature in the raw. The 
scientific problem is always to describe the phenomena as accurately as possible, and to 
trace the interconnections among different kinds of phenomena. 
In the great works of science, there is no oratory or propaganda, though there may be 
bias in the sense of initial presuppositions. You detect this, and take account of it, by 
distinguishing what the author assumes from what he establishes through argument. The 
more "objective" a scientific author is, the more he will explicitly beg you to take this or 
that for granted. Scientific objectivity is not the absence of initial bias. It is attained by 
frank confession of it. 
The leading terms in a scientific work are usually expressed by uncommon or technical 
words. They are relatively easy to spot, and through them you can readily grasp the 
propositions. The main propositions are always general ones. A scientist, unlike a 
historian, tries to get away from locality in time and place. He tries to say how things 
are generally, how they generally behave. 
The only point of difficulty is with respect to the arguments. Science, as you know, is 
primarily inductive. This means that its primary arguments are those which establish. a 
general proposition by reference to observable evidence！a single case created by an 
experiment, or a vast array of cases collected by patient inquiry. There are other 
arguments of the sort which are called deductive. These are arguments in which a 
proposition is proved by other propositions already somehow established. So far as 
proof is concerned, science does not differ much from philosophy. But the inductive 
argument is peculiar to science. 

To understand and judge the inductive arguments in a scientific book, you must be able 
to follow the evidence which the scientist reports as their basis. Sometimes the 
scientist's description of an experiment performed is so vivid and clear that you have no 
trouble. Sometimes a scientific book contains illustrations and diagrams which help to 
acquaint you with the phenomena described. 
If these things fail, the reader has only one recourse. He must get the necessary special 
experience for himself at first hand. He may have to witness a laboratory demonstration. 
He may have to look at and handle pieces of apparatus similar to those referred to in the 
book. He may have to go to a museum and observe specimens or models. 
That is the reason why St. John's College in Annapolis, where all students read the great 
books, also requires four years of laboratory work for all students. The student must not 
only learn how to employ apparatus for precise measurements and laboratory 
constructions, but he must also become acquainted, through direct experience, with the 
crucial experiments in the history of science. There are classical experiments as well as 
classical books. The scientific classics become more intelligible to those who have seen 
with their own eyes and done with their own hands what a great scientist describes as 
the procedure by which he reached his insights. 
Thus you see how the major extrinsic aid in the reading of scientific books is not the 
reading of other books but rather getting a direct acquaintance with the phenomena 
involved. In proportion as the experience to be obtained is highly specialized, it is both 
more indispensable and more difficult to get. 
I do not mean, of course, that extrinsic reading may not be helpful, too. Other books 
about the same subject matter may throw light on the problems, and help us to be 
critical of the book we are reading. They may locate points of misinformation, lack of 
evidence, incompleteness of analysis. But I still think that the primary aid is the one 
which throws direct light on the inductive arguments that are the heart of any scientific 
book.

The reading of philosophical works has special aspects which relate to the difference 
between philosophy and science. I am considering here only theoretic works in 
philosophy, such as metaphysical treatises or books about the philosophy of nature, 
because ethical and political books have already been treated. They are practical 
philosophy. 
The philosophical problem is to explain, not to describe, the nature of things. It asks 
about more than the connection of phenomena. It seeks to penetrate to the ultimate 
causes and conditions of things, as existing and changing. Such problems are solved 
only when the answers to them are clearly demonstrated. 
The major effort of the reader here must be with respect to the terms and the initial 
propositions. Although the philosopher also has a technical terminology, the words 
which express his terms are often taken from common speech and used in a very special 
sense. This demands special care from the reader. If he does not overcome the tendency 
to use familiar words in a familiar way, he will probably make gibberish and nonsense 
of the book. I have seen many people throw a philosophical book away in disgust or 
irritation, when the fault was theirs, not the author's. They did not even try to come to 
terms. 

The basic terms of philosophical discussion are, of course, abstract. But so are those of 
science. No general knowledge is expressible except in abstract terms. There is notliing 
peculiarly difficult about abstractions. We use them every day of our lives and in every 
sort of conversation. If you substitute the distinction between the particular and the 
general for that between the concrete and the abstract, you will have less fear of 
abstractions. 
Whenever you talk generally about anything, you are using abstractions. What you can 
perceive through your senses is concrete and particular. What you think with your mind 
is always abstract and general. To understand an "abstract word" is to have the idea it 
expresses. "Having an idea" is just another way of saying that you know a general 
aspect of something, to which the mind can refer. You cannot see or touch or even 
imagine the aspect thus referred to. If you could, there would be no difference between 
the senses and the mind. People who try to imagine what ideas refer to befuddle 
themselves, and end up with that hopeless feeling about all abstractions. 
Just as the inductive arguments should be the reader's main focus in the case of 
scientific books, so here you must pay closest attention to the philosopher's principles. 
The word "principle" means a beginning. The propositions with which a philosopher 
begins are his principles. They may be either things he asks you to assume with him, or 
matters which he calls self-evident. 
There is no problem about assumptions. Make them to see what follows, even if you 
yourself have contrary presuppositions. The clearer you are about your own prejudg-
ments, the more likely you are not to misjudge those made by others. 
It is the other sort of principle, however, which may cause you trouble. I know of no 
philosophical book which does not have some initial propositions the author regards as 
self-evident. These propositions are like the scientist's inductions in one respect. They 
are drawn directly from experience rather than proved by other propositions. 
The difference lies in the experience from which they are drawn. The philosopher 
appeals to the common experience of mankind. He does no work in laboratories or 
research in the field. Hence to understand and test a philosopher's leading principles you 
do not need the extrinsic aid of special experience. He refers you to your own common 
sense and daily observation of the world in which you live. 
Once you have grasped a philosopher's terms and principles, the rest of your task in 
reading his book raises no special difficulties. You must follow the proofs, of course. 
You must note every step he takes in the progress of his analysis！his definitions and 
distinctions, his ordering of terms. But the same is true in the case of a scientific book. 
Acquaintance with the evidence, in the one case, and acceptance of the principles, in the 
other, are the indispensable conditions for following all the remaining arguments. 
A good theoretic work in philosophy is as free from oratory and propaganda as a good 
scientific treatise. You do not have to be concerned about the "personality" of the 
author, or investigate his social and economic backgrounds. There is utility, 
nevertheless, in doing extrinsic reading in connection with a philosophical book. You 
should read the works of other great philosophers who dealt with the same problems. 
The philosophers have carried on a long conversation with one another in the history of 
thought. You had better listen in on it before you make up your mind about what any 
one of them says. 

The fact that philosophers disagree does not make them different from other men. In 
reading philosophical books, you must remember, above all, the maxim to respect the 
difference between knowledge and opinion. The fact of disagreement must not lead you 
to suppose that everything is just a matter of opinion. Persistent disagreements 
sometimes locate the great unsolved and, perhaps, insoluble problems. They point to the 
mysteries. But where problems are genuinely answerable by knowledge, you must not 
forget that men can agree if they will talk to one another long enough. 
Do not worry about the disagreement of others. Your responsibility is only for making 
up your own mind. In the presence of the long conversation which the philosophers 
have had through their books, you must judge what is true and false. When you have 
read a philosophical book well ！and that means sufficient extrinsic reading as well as 
skill-tul interpretation！you are in a position to judge. 
The most distinctive mark of philosophical questions is that every man must answer 
them for himself. Taking the opinions of others is not solving them, but evading them. 
They are answered only by knowledge, and it must be your knowledge. You cannot 
depend on the testimony of the experts, as you may have to in the case of science. 
There are two further points about extrinsic reading in connection with philosophical 
books. Do not spend all your time reading books about the philosophers, their lives and 
opinions. Try reading the philosophers themselves, in relation to one another. And in 
reading ancient and medieval -philosophers, or even the early modems, do not be 
disturbed by the errors or inadequacies of scientific knowledge which their books 
reveal. 
Philosophical knowledge rests directly on common experience and not on the findings 
of science, not on the results of specialized research. You will see, if you follow the 
arguments carefully, that the misinformation or lack of information about scientific 
matters is irrelevant. 
This second point makes it important to note the date of the philosopher you are 
reading. That will not only place him properly in the conversation with those who came 
before and after, but prepare you for the sort of scientific imagery he will employ to 
illustrate some of his points. The same urbanity which makes you indulgent of those 
who speak a foreign tongue should lead you to cultivate a tolerance for men of wisdom 
who did not know all the facts we now possess. Both may have something to say that 
we would be fools not to listen to, simply because of our provincialism. 
 - 7 - 
There are two classes of books I have tailed to mention specially. One is mathematics, 
the other theology. My reason is that at one level of reading, they do not present special 
problems. And at another, the problems they present are much too complicated and 
difficult for me to handle here. Perhaps I can say a few simple things about them, 
however. 
In general, the type of proposition and the type of argument in a mathematical book are 
philosophical rather than scientific. The mathematician like the philosopher is an 
armchair thinker. He does no experiments. He undertakes no special observations. From 
principles, which are either self-evident or assumed, he proves his conclusions, and 
solves his problems. 

The difficulty in reading mathematical books arises in part from the kind of symbols the 
mathematician uses. He writes in a special language, not that of ordinary speech. It has a 
special grammar, a special syntax, and special rules of operation. In part, also, the 
precise method of mathematical demonstration is peculiar to this one subject matter. We 
have already seen many times that Euclid and others who write mathematically have a 
distinctly different style from that of other authors. 
You must know the special grammar and logic of mathematics if you are to become an 
accomplished reader of mathematical books. The general rules we have discussed can 
be applied intelligently to this subject matter only through understanding them in the 
light of special principles. I might add that the logic of scientific argument and of 
philosophical proof are also different,''not only from mathematics, but from each other. 
The insight I would like you to get here is that there are as many special grammars and 
logics as there are specifically different applications of the rules of reading to different 
kinds of books and subject matters. 
A word about theology. It differs from philosophy in that its first principles are articles 
of faith adhered to by the communicants of some religion. Reasoning which rests on 
premises to which reason can itself attain is philosophical, not theological. A theological 
book always depends upon dogmas and the authority of a church which proclaims them. 
If you are not of the faith, if you do not belong to the church, you can nevertheless read 
a theological book well by treating its dogmas with the same respect you treat the 
assumptions of the mathematician. But you must remember that an article of faith is not 
something which the faithful assume. Faith, for those who have it, is the most certain 
form of knowledge, not a tentative opinion. 
There is one kind of extrinsic reading peculiar to theological works. Those who have 
faith believe in the revealed word of God, as that is contained in a sacred scripture. 
Thus, Jewish theology requires that its readers be acquainted with the Old Testament, 
Christian theology with the New as well, Mohammedan theology with the Koran, and 
so forth. 
Here I must stop. The problem of reading the Holy Book！if you have faith that it is the 
Word of God！is the most difficult problem in the whole field of reading. There have 
been more books written about how to read Scripture than about all other aspects of the 
art of reading together. The Word of God is obviously the most difficult writing men 
can read. The effort of the faithful has been duly proportionate to the difficulty of the 
task. I think it would be true to say that, in the European tradition at least, the Bible is 
the book in more senses than one. It has been not only the most widely read but the 
most carefully. 
 - 8 - 
Let me close this chapter with a brief summary of the extrinsic aids to reading. What 
lies beyond the book you are reading? Three things, it seems to me, which are especially 
relevant: experience！common or special; other books; and live discussion. The role of 
experience as an extrinsic factor is, I think, sufficiently clear. Other books may be of 
various sorts. They may be reference books, secondary books, and commentaries, or 
other great books, dealing with the same or with related matters. 
Following all the rules of intrinsic reading is seldom sufficient to read any book well, 
either interpretatively or critically. Experience and other books are indispensable 
extrinsic aids. In reading books with students, I am as frequently impressed by the fact 

that they do not employ these aids as that they do not know how to read the book by 
itself. 
Under the elective system, a student takes a course as if it were something quite apart. 
One course has no connec tion with another, and no course seems to have any 
connection with his ordinary affairs, his vital problems, his daily experience. Students 
who take courses this way read books in the same way. They make no effort to connect 
one book with another, even when they are most obviously related, or to refer what the 
author is saying to,.their own experience. They read about Fascism and Communism in 
the newspapers. They hear defenses of democracy over the radio. But it never seems to 
occur to most of them that the great political treatise they may be reading deals with the 
same problems, though the language it speaks is a little more elegant. 
Only last year Mr. Hutchins and I read a series of political works with some students. At 
first, they tended to read each book as if it existed in a vacuum. Despite the fact that the 
various authors were plainly arguing about the same thing, they did not seem to think 
that it was worth while to mention one book in discussing another. But the good 
students could make all these connections when called upon to do so. We had one of our 
most exciting class hours after Mr. Hutchins had asked whether Hobbes would have 
defended Hitler for keeping Pastor Niemoller in a concentration camp. Would Spinoza 
have tried to get him out? What would Locke have done, and John Stuart Mill? 
The problems of free speech and free conscience found dead authors talking about 
living issues. The students took sides on the Niemoller question, and so did the books-
Mill against Hobbes, and Locke against Spinoza. Even if the students could not help 
Pastor Niemoller, his case had helped them focus the opposition of political principles 
in the light of their practical consequences. Students who before had seen nothing 
wrong with Hobbes and Spinoza now began to doubt their prior judgments. 
The utility of extrinsic reading is simply an extension of the value of context in reading 
a book by itself. We have seen how the context must be used to interpret words and 
sentences to find terms and propositions. Just as the whole book is a context for any of 
its parts, so related books provide an even larger context that helps you interpret the one 
you are reading. 
I like to think of the great books as involved in a prolonged conversation about the basic 
problems of mankind. The great authors were great readers, and one way to understand 
them is to read the books they read. As readers, they carried on a conversation with 
other authors, just as each of us carries on a conversation with the books we read, 
though we may not write other books. 
To get into this conversation, we must read the great books in relation to one another, 
and in an order that somehow respects chronology. The conversation of the books takes 
place in time. Time is of the essence here and should not be disregarded. The books can 
be read from the present into the past or from the past into the present., Though I think 
the order from past to present has certain advantages, through being more natural, the 
fact of chronology can be observed in either way. 
The conversational aspect of reading (the authors conversing with one another, and any 
reader conversing with his author) explains the third extrinsic factor I mentioned above, 
namely, live discussion. By live discussion, I mean no more than the actual conversation 
you and I may have together about a book we have read in common. 

While this is not an indispensable aid to reading, it is certainly a great help. That is why 
Mr. Hutchins and I conduct our course in reading books by meeting with the students to 
discuss them. The reader who learns to discuss a book well with other readers may 
come thereby to have better conversations with the author when he has him alone in his 
study. He may even come to appreciate better the conversation which the authors had 
with one another. 
PART III . 
 THE REST OF THE READER'S LIFE 
[ The Other half] [ The Great Books] [ Free Minds and Free Men] 
 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
The Other half 
 - 1 - 
this is only half a book on reading, or perhaps I should say that so far it has been 
concerned with only halt the reading that most people do. Even that might be too liberal 
an estimate. I am not so naive as to suppose that most of the reader's life will be spent in 
reading the great books. Probably the greater part of anybody's reading time is spent on 
newspapers and magazines. And so far as books are concerned, most of us read more 
fiction than nonfiction. True, the best-seller lists are usually divided in half: fiction and 
nonfiction. But although the nonfiction books often reach large audiences, their total 
audience is somewhat less than the audience of fiction, good and bad. Of the nonfiction 
books, the most popular are frequently those which, like the newspapers and magazines, 
deal with matters of contemporary interest. 
I have not deceived you about the rules set forth in preceding chapters. In Chapter 
Seven, before undertaking a detailed discussion of the rules, I explained that we wo"ld 
have to limit ourselves to the business of reading serious I' nonfiction books. To 
expound the rules for reading imaginative and expository literature at the same time 
would be confusing, and an adequate treatment of the reading of fiction or poetry could 
not be managed in less space than it took to discuss the nonfiction rules. I seemed to be 
faced with the choice of writing a much longer book, perhaps even another one, or 
ignoring half the reading people do. For the sake of clarity, I took the second alternative 
while writing the preceding part of this book. But now, when I consider the rest of the 
reader's life, I cannot ignore the other types of reading any longer. I shall try to make up 
for these deficiencies, even though I know that a single chapter devoted to all other 
kinds of reading must be inadequate. 
I would be far from frank if I let you think that lack of space was my only shortcoming. 
I must confess that I have much less competence for the task this chapter undertakes, 
though I might add, in extenuation, that the problem of knowing how to read 
imaginative literature is inherently much more difficult. Nevertheless, you may think 
that the need to formulate rules for reading fiction is less urgent, because more people 
seem to know how to read fiction and get something out of it than nonfiction. 

Observe the paradox here. On the one hand, I say that skill in reading fiction is more 
difficult to analyze; on the other, it seems to be a fact that such skill is more widely 
possessed than the art of reading science and philosophy, politics, economics, and 
history. It may be, of course, that people deceive themselves about their ability to read 
novels intelligently. If that is not the case, I think I can explain the paradox another way. 
Imaginative literature delights primarily rather than instructs. It is much easier to be 
delighted than instructed, but much harder to know why one is delighted. Beauty is more 
elusive, analytically, than truth. 
From my teaching experience, I know how tongue-tied people become when asked to 
say what they liked about a novel. That they enjoyed it is perfectly clear to them, but 
they cannot give much account of their enjoyment or tell what the book contained which 
caused them pleasure. This indicates, you may say, that people can be good readers of 
fiction without being good critics. I suspect this is, at best, a half-truth. A critical 
reading of anything depends upon the fullness of one's apprehension. Those who cannot 
say what they like about a novel probably have not read it below its most obvious 
surfaces. 
To make this last point clear would require an explicit formulation of all the rules for 
reading imaginative literature. Lacking both space and competence to do that, I shall 
offer you two short cuts. The first proceeds by the way of negation, stating the obvious 
"don'ts" instead of the constructive rules. The second proceeds by the way of analogy, 
briefly translating the rules for reading nonfiction into their equivalents for reading 
fiction. I shall use the word "fiction" to name all of imaginative literature, including 
lyric poetry as well as novels and plays. Lyric poetry really deserves a separate and 
elaborate discussion. In fact, just as in the case of expository books, where the general 
rules must be particularized for history, science, and philosophy, so here an adequate 
treatment would have to consider the special problems involved in reading the novel, 
the drama, and the lyric. But we shall have to be satisfied with much less. 
 - 2 - 
In order to proceed by the way of negation, it is first of all necessary to grasp the basic 
differences between expository and imaginative literature. These differences will 
explain why we cannot read a novel as if it were a philosophical argument, or a lyric as 
if it were a mathematical demonstration. 
The most obvious difference, already mentioned, relates to the purposes of the two 
kinds of writing. Expository books aim primarily to instruct, imaginative ones to 
delight. The former try to convey knowledge！knowledge about experiences which the 
reader either has or could have. The latter try to communicate an experience itself！ one 
which the reader can get only by reading！and if they succeed they give the reader 
something to be enjoyed. Because of their diverse intentions, the two sorts of work 
appeal differently to the intellect and the imagination. 
We experience things through the exercise of our senses and imagination. To know 
anything we must use our powers of judgment and reasoning, which are intellectual. I 
do not mean that we can think without using our imagination, or that sense experience is 
ever divorced from some rational reflection. The point is only one of emphasis. Fiction 
appeals primarily to the imagination. That is the reason tor calling it imaginative 
literature, in contrast to science and philosophy which are intellectual. 
We have been considering reading as an activity by which we receive communication 
from others. If we look a little more deeply now, we shall see that expository books do 

communicate what is eminently and essentially communicable！abi(rac( knowledge; 
whereas imaginative books try to communicate what is essentially and profoundly 
incommunicable！concrete experience. There is something mysterious about this. If 
concrete experience is really incommunicable, by what magic does the poet or novelist 
hope to convey to you for your enjoyment an experience which he has enjoyed? 
Before I answer this question, I must be sure that you fully realize the 
incommunicability of concrete experience. 
Everyone has gone through some intense emotional crisis！ the quick wave of anger, 
prolonged anxiety about an impending disaster, the cycle of hope and despair in love. 
Have you ever tried to tell your friends about it? You can tell them all the facts without 
much trouble, because the outward and observable facts are matters of ordinary 
knowledge and can be easily communicated. But can you give them the experience 
itself, in all its concrete inwardness！ the experience which you find difficult even to 
remember in its fullness and intensity? If your own memory of it is pale and 
fragmentary, how much more so must be the impression you are conveying by your 
words. As you watch the faces of your listeners, you can tell that they are not having the 
experience you are talking about. And you may realize then that it takes more narrative 
art than you possess！an art which is the distinctive possession of the great imaginative 
writers. 
In one sense, of course, even the greatest writer cannot communicate his own 
experiences. They are uniquely his through all eternity. A man can share his knowledge 
with Others, but he cannot share the actual pulsations of his life. Since unique and 
concrete experience cannot be communicated, the artist does the next best thing. He 
creates in the reader what he cannot convey. He uses words to produce an experience 
for the reader to enjoy, an experience which the reader lives through in a manner similar 
and proportionate to the writer's own. His language so works upon the emotions and 
imagination of each reader that each in turn suffers an experience he has never had 
before, even though memories may be evoked in the process. These new experiences, 
different for each reader according to his own individual nature and memories, are 
nevertheless alike, because they are all created according to the same model！the 
incommunicable experiences on which the writer draws. We are like so many 
instruments for him to play upon, each with its .special overtones and resonances, but 
the music that he plays so differently on each of us follows one and the same score. That 
score is written into the novel or poem. As we read it, it seems to communicate, but it 
really creates, an experience. That is the magic of good fiction, which creates 
imaginatively the similitude of an actual experience. 
I cannot substantiate what I have said by quoting a whole novel or play. I can only ask 
the reader to remember and dwell upon what happened to him while he was reading 
some fiction which moved him deeply. Did he learn facts about the world? Did he 
follow arguments and proofs? Or did he suffer a novel experience actually created in hi. 
imagination during the process of reading? 
I can, however, quote a few short and simple lyrics, widely familiar. The first is by 
Robert Herrick: 
 Whenas in silks my Julia goes, 
Then, then, methinks, how sweetly flows 
That liquefaction of her clothes. 

Next, when I cast mine eyes, and see 
That brave vibration, each way free, 
0, how that glittering taketh me! 
The second is by Percy Bysshe Shelley: 
Music, when soft voices die, 
Vibrates in the memory- 
Odors, when sweet violets sicken, 
Live within the sense they quicken. 
 Rose leaves, when the rose is dead, 
Are heaped for the beloved's bed; 
And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone, 
Love itself shall slumber on. 
 The third is by Gerard Manley Hopkins: 
Glory be to God for dappled things！ 
 For skies of couple-color as a brindled cow; 
 For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim; 
Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings; 
 Landscape plotted and pieced！fold, fallow, and plough; 
 And all trades, their gear and tackle and trim. 
 
 All things counter, original, spare, strange; 
 Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?) 
 With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim; 
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change: 
 Praise him. 
Different in their objects and in the complexity of the emotions told about, these lyrics 
work upon us in the same way. They play upon our senses directly by the music of their 
words, but more than that, they evoke imaginations and memories which blend into a 
single whole of significant experience. Each word is counted on to do its part, not only 
musically in the pattern of sounds but also as a command to remember or imagine. The 
poet has so directed our faculties that, without being aware of how it happened, we have 
enjoyed an experience, not of our making but of his. We have not received something 
from him, as we re" ceive knowledge from a scientific writer. Rather we have suffered 
ourselves to be the medium of his creation. He has used words to get into our hearts 
and fancies and move them to an experience that reflects his own as one dream might 
resemble another. In fact, by some strange manner of effluence, the poet's dream is 
dreamed differently by each of us. 
The basic difference between expository and imaginative literature！that one instructs 
by communicating, whereas the other delights by recreating what cannot be 
communicated！leads to another difference. Because of their radically diverse aims, 
these two kinds of writing necessarily use language differently. The imaginative writer 
tries to maximize the latent ambiguities of words, thereby to gain all the richness and 
force that is inherent in their multiple meanings. He uses metaphors as the units of his 
construction just as the logical writer uses words sharpened to a single meaning. What 
Dante says of The Divine Comedy, that it must be read as having four distinct though 
related meanings, generally applies to poetry and fiction. The logic of expository 
writing aims at an ideal of unambiguous explicit-ness. Nothing should be left between 

the lines. Everything that is relevant and statable should be said as explicitly and clearly 
as possible. In contrast, imaginative writing relies upon what is implied rather than upon 
what is said. The multiplication of metaphors puts more content between the lines than 
in the words which compose them. The whole poem or novel says something which 
none of its words say or can say: it speaks the incommunicable experience it has re-
created for the reader. 
Taking lyric poetry and mathematics as the ideals, or perhaps I should say the two 
extreme forms of imaginative and expository writing, we can see another and 
consequent difference between the poetical and logical dimensions of grammar. A 
mathematical statement is indefinitely translatable into other statements expressing the 
same truth. The great French scientist Poincare once said that mathematics was the art 
of saying the same thing in as many different ways as possible. Anyone who has 
watched an equation undergo the countless transformations to which it is subject will 
understand this. At each stage, the actual symbols may be different or in a different 
order, but the same mathematical relationship is being expressed. In contrast, a poetic 
statement is absolutely untranslatable, not only from one language to another, but within 
the same language from one set of words to another. You cannot say what is said by 
"Music, when soft voices die, vibrates in the memory" in any other English words. Here 
is no proposition which can be expressed in many equivalent sentences, all equally 
rendering the same truth. Here is a use of words to move the imagination, not to instruct 
the mind; in consequence, only these words, and in this order, can do what the poet 
contrived them for. Any other form of words will create another experience！better or 
worse, but in any case different. 
You may object that I have drawn the line too sharply between the two kinds of writing. 
You may insist, for instance, that we can be instructed as well as delighted by 
imaginative literature. Of course we can, but not in the same way as we are taught by 
scientific and philosophical books. We learn from experience！the experience that we 
have in the course of our daily lives. So, too, we can learn from the vicarious, or 
artistically created, experiences which fiction produces in our imagination. In this sense, 
poetry and novels instruct as well as delight. The sense in which science and philosophy 
teach us is different. Expository books do not provide us with novel experiences. They 
comment on such experiences as we already have or can get. That is why it seems right 
to say that expository books teach primarily, while imaginative books teach only 
incidentally, if at all, by creating experiences from which we can learn. In order to learn 
from such books, we have to do our own thinking about experience; in order to learn 
from scientists and philosophers, we must first try to understand the thinking they have 
done. 
I have emphasized these various differences in order to state a few negative rules. They 
do not tell you how to read fiction. They tell you merely what not to do, because fiction 
is different from science. All of these "don'ts" boil down to one simple insight: don't 
read fiction as it it were fact; don't read a novel as if it were a scientific work, not even 
as if it were social science or psychology. This one insight is variously expanded by the 
following rules. 
(1) Don't try to find a "message" in a novel, play, or poem. Imaginative writing is not 
primarily didactic. No great work of fiction is the sugar-coated propaganda that some 
recent critics would have us believe they all are. (It Uncle Tom's Cabin and The Grapes 
of Wrath are good fiction, they are so in spite of, not because of, what they preach.) I am 
not here making a sharp division between pure art and propaganda, for we know that 
fiction can move men to action, often more effectively than oratory My point is rather 
that fiction has this force only when it is good as fiction！not when it is a sermon or 

harangue thinly wrapped in a poorly told fable. If the general precept is wise！that you 
should read a book for what it is！then look for the story, not the message, in books 
which offer themselves as narratives. 
The plays of Shakespeare have been anatomized for centuries to discover their hidden 
message！as if Shakespeare had a secret philosophy which he cryptically concealed 
within his plays. The search has been fruitless. Its failure should be a classic warning 
against the misreading of fiction. How much sounder is the approach which finds each 
play a new world of experience that Shakespeare opens for us. Mark Van Doren, in his 
recent book on Shakespeare, wisely begins by telling us that he finds creations, not 
thoughts or doctrines, in the plays: 
 
The great and central virtue of Shakespeare was not achieved by taking thought, for 
thought cannot create a world. It can only understand one when one has been created. 
Shakespeare, starting with the world no man has made, and never indeed abandoning it, 
made many worlds within it. ... While we read a play of Shakespeare we are in it. We 
may be drawn in swiftly or slowly！in most cases swiftly！but once we are there we 
are enclosed. That is the secret, and it is still the secret of Shakespeare's power to 
interest us. He conditions us to a particular world before we are aware that it exists; then 
he absorbs us in its particulars. 
 
The way in which Mr. Van Doren reads the plays of Shakespeare provides a model for 
reading any fiction worthy of the name. 
(2) Don't look for terms, propositions, and arguments in imaginative literature. Such 
things are logical, not poetic, devices. They are proper to that use of language which 
aims at communicating knowledge and ideas, but they are utterly foreign when 
language serves as a medium for the incommunicable！when it is employed creatively. 
As Mr. Van Doren says, "In poetry and in drama statement is one of the obscurer 
mediums." I think I would go further and say that in fiction there are no statements at 
all, no verbal declarations of the writer's beliefs. What a lyric poem "states," for 
instance, cannot be found in any of its sentences. And the whole, comprising all its 
words in their reactions upon each other, says something which can never be confined 
within the strait jacket of propositions. 
(3) Don't criticize fiction by the standards of truth and consistency which properly apply 
to communications of ~ knowledge. The "truth" of a good story is its verisimilitude, its 
intrinsic probability or plausibility. It must be a likely story, but it need not describe the 
facts of life or society in a manner that is verifiable by experiment or research. Centuries 
ago, Aristotle remarked that "the standard of correctness is not the same in poetry as in 
politics," or in physics or psychology for that matter. Technical inaccuracies about 
anatomy or errors in geography and history should be criticized when the book in which 
they occur offers itself as a treatise on those subjects. But mis-statements of fact do not 
mar a story if its teller succeeds in surrounding them with plausibility. When we read a 
biography, we want the truth about a particular man's life. When we read a novel we 
want a story that must be true only in the sense that it could have happened in the world 
of characters and events which the novelist has created. 

(4) Don't read all imaginative books eis if they were the same. Just as in the case of 
expository literature, here, too, there are differences in kind！the lyric, the novel, the 
play！which require appropriately different readings. 
To make these "don'ts" more helpful, they must be supplemented by constructive 
suggestions. By developing the analogy between reading books of tact and books ot 
fiction, I may be able to take you through another short cut to the rules for reading the 
latter. 
 
 - 3 - 
There are, as we have seen, three groups of rules for reading expository books. The first 
set consists of rules for discovering the unity and part-whole structure; the second 
consists of rules for analyzing the whole into its component terms, propositions, and 
arguments; the third consists of rules for criticizing the author's doctrine so that we can 
reach an intelligent agreement or disagreement with him. We have called these three 
groups of rules structural, interpretive, and critical. If there is any analogy at all 
between reading expository and imaginative books, we should be able to find similar 
sets of rules to guide us in the latter case. 
First, what are the structural rules for reading fiction? If you can remember the rules of 
this sort which we have already discussed (and if you cannot, you will find them 
summarized at the opening of Chapter Fourteen), I shall now translate-them briefly into 
their fictional analogues: 
(1) You must classify a piece of imaginative literature according to its kind. You must 
know whether it is a novel . or a play or a lyric. A lyric tells its story primarily in terms 
of a single emotional experience, whereas novels and plays have much more 
complicated plots, involving many characters, their actions and reactions upon one 
another, as well as the emotions they suffer in the process. Everyone knows, 
furthermore, that a play differs from a novel by reason of the fact that it narrates entirely 
by means of actions and speeches. The author can never speak in his own person, as he 
can, and frequently does, in the course of a novel, All of these differences in manner of 
writing call for differences in the reader's receptivity. Therefore, you should recognize 
at once the kind of fiction you are reading. 
(2) You must grasp the unity of the whole work. Whether you have done this or not can 
be tested by whether you are able to express that unity in a sentence or two. The unity of 
an expository book resides ultimately in the main problem which it tries to solve. Hence 
its unity can be stated by the formulation of this question, or by the propositions which 
answer it. But the unity of fiction is always in its plot. I cannot stress too much the 
difference between problem and plot as respectively the sources of unity in expository 
and imaginative writing. You have not grasped the whole story until you can summarize 
its plot in a brief narration！not a proposition or argument. It you have an old-fashioned 
edition of Shakespeare at hand, you may find that each play is prefaced by a paragraph 
which is called "the argument." It consists of nothing more than the story in brief！a 
condensation of the plot. Herein lies the unity of the play. 
(3) You must not only reduce the whole to its simplest unity, you must also discover 
how that whole is constructed out of all its parts. The parts of an expository book are 
concerned with parts of the whole problem, the partial solutions contributing to the 
solution of the whole. But the parts of fiction are the various steps which the author 

takes to develop his plot！the details of characterization and incident. The way in which 
the parts are arranged differs in the two cases. In science and philosophy, they must be 
ordered logically. In a story, the parts must somehow fit into a temporal scheme, a 
progress from a beginning through the middle to its end. To know the structure of a 
narrative, you must know where it begins, what it goes through, and where it ends. You 
must know die various crises which lead up to the climax, where and how the climax 
occurs, and what happens in the aftermath. 
A number of consequences follow from the points I have just made. For one thing, the 
parts or subwholes of an expository book are more likely to be independently readable 
than the parts of fiction. The first book of Euclid's thirteen！though it is a part of the 
whole work！can be read by itself. That is more or less the case with every well-
organized expository book. Its sections or chapters, taken separately or in subgroups, 
make sense. But the chapters of a novel, or the acts of a play, become relatively 
meaningless when wrenched from the whole. 
For another thing, the expository writer need not keep you in suspense. He can tell you 
in his preface or opening paragraphs precisely what he is going to do and how he is 
going to do it. Your interest is not dulled by such advance information; on the contrary, 
you are grateful for the guidance. But narrative, to be interesting, must sustain and 
heighten the suspense. Here suspense is of the essence. Even when you know the unity 
of the plot in advance, as that may be advertised by the "argument" which prefaces a 
Shakespearean play, everything that creates suspense must remain concealed. You must 
not be able to guess the precise steps by which the conclusion is reached. However few 
the number of original plots, the good writer achieves novelty and suspense by the skill 
with which he hides the turns his narrative takes in covering familial ground. 
Second, what are the interpretive rules for reading fiction? Our prior consideration of 
the difference between a poetic and a logical use of language prepares us to make a 
translation of the rules which direct us to find the terms, the propositions, and the 
arguments. We know we should not do that. But what should we look for if we try to 
analyze fiction? 
(1) The elements of fiction are its episodes and incidents, its characters, and their 
thoughts, speeches, feelings, and actions. Each of these is an elementary part of the 
world which the author creates. By manipulating these elements, the author tells his 
story. They are like the terms in logical discourse. Just as you must come to terms with 
an expository writer, so here you must become acquainted with the details of incident 
and characterization. You have not grasped a story until you are really familiar with its 
characters, until you have lived through its events. 
(2) Terms are connected in propositions. The elements of fiction are connected by the 
total scene or background against which they stand out in relief. The imaginative writer, 
we have seen, creates a world in which his characters "live, move, and have their 
being." The fictional analogue of the rule which directs you to find the author's 
propositions can, therefore, be stated as follows: become at home in this imaginary 
world; know it as if you were an observer on the scene; become a member of its 
population, willing to befriend its characters, and able to participate in its happenings by 
sympathetic insight, as you would do in the actions and sufferings of a friend. If you can 
do this, the elements of fiction will cease to be so many isolated pawns moved about 
mechanically on a chessboard. You will have found the connections which vitalize them 
into the members of a living society. 

(3) If there is any motion in an expository book, it is the movement of the argument, a 
logical transition from evidences and reasons to the conclusions they support. In the 
reading of such books, it is necessary to follow the argument. Hence, after you have 
discovered its terms and propositions, you are called upon to analyze its reasoning. 
There is an analogous last step in the interpretive reading of fiction. You have become 
acquainted with the characters. You have joined them in the imaginary world wherein 
they dwell, consented to the laws of their society, breathed its air, tasted its food, 
traveled on its highways. Now you must follow them through their adventures. The 
scene or background, the social setting, is (like the proposition) a kind of static 
connection of the elements of fiction. The unraveling of the plot (like the arguments or 
reasoning) is the dynamic connection. Aristotle said that plot is the soul of a story. It is 
its life. To read a story well you must have your finger on the pulse of the narrative, 
sensitive to its every beat. 
Before leaving these fictional equivalents for the interpretive rules of reading, I must 
caution you not to examine the analogy too closely. An analogy of this sort is like a 
metaphor which will disintegrate if you press it too hard, I have used it only to give you 
the feel of how fiction can be read analytically. The three steps I have suggested outline 
the way in which one becomes progressively aware of the artistic achievement of an 
imaginative writer. Far from spoiling your enjoyment of a novel or play, they should 
enable you to enrich your pleasure by knowing intimately the sources of your delight. 
You will not only know what you like but also why you like it. 
One other caution: the foregoing rules apply mainly to novels and plays. To the extent 
that lyric poems have some narrative line, they apply to lyrics also. But the heart of a 
lyric lies elsewhere. It really requires a special set of rules to lead you to its secret. The 
interpretive reading of lyric poetry is a special problem which I have neither the 
competence nor the space to discuss. I have already mentioned (in Chapter Seven) some 
books which may be helpful in this connection. To those I might add the following: 
Wordsworth's preface to the first edition of Lyrical Ballads, Matthew Arnold's Essays in 
Criticism, Edgar Allan Poe's essays on The Poetic Principle and The Philosophy of 
Composition, T. S. Eliot's work on The Use of Poetry, Herbert Read's Form in Modern 
Poetry, and Mark Van Doren's preface to An Anthology of English and American 
Poetry. 
While I am recommending books, perhaps I should also mention a few that may help 
you develop your analytical powers in reading novels: Percy Lubbock's The Craft of 
Fiction, E. M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel, Edwin Muir's The Structure of the Novel, 
and Henry James's prefaces collected under the title The Art of the Novel. For the 
reading of drama, nothing has replaced Aristotle's analysis of tragedy and comedy in the 
Poetics. Where it needs to be supplemented for modern departures in the art of the 
theater, such books as George Meredith's essay On Comedy and Bernard Shaw's The 
(Quintessence of Ibsenism can be consulted. 
Third, and last, what are the critical rules tor reading fiction? You may remember that 
we distinguished, in the case of expository works, between the general maxims 
governing criticism and a number of particular points！specific critical remarks. With 
respect to the general maxims, the analogy can be sufficiently drawn by one translation. 
Where, in the case of expository works, the advice was not to criticize a book！not to 
say you agree or disagree！until you can first say you understand, so here the maxim is: 
don't criticize imaginative writing until you fully appreciate what the author has tried to 
make you experience. 

To explain this maxim, I must remind you of the obvious fact that we do not agree or 
disagree with fiction. We either like it or we do not. Our critical judgment in the case of 
expository books concerns their truth, whereas in criticizing belles-lettres, as the word 
itself suggests, we consider their beauty. The beauty of any work of art is related to the 
pleasure it gives us when we know it well. 
Now there is an important difference here between logical and esthetic criticism. When 
we agree with a scientific book, a philosophy, or history, we do so because we think it 
speaks the truth. But when we like a poem, a novel, or play, we should hesitate, at least 
a moment, before attributing beauty, or artistic goodness, to the work which pleases us. 
We must remember that in matters of taste there is much divergence among men, and 
that some men, through greater cultivation, have better taste than others. While it is 
highly probable that what a man of really good taste likes is in itself a beautiful work, it 
is much less probable that the likes and dislikes of the uncultivated signify artistic 
perfections or failures. We must distinguish, in short, between the expression of taste 
which merely bespeaks liking or disliking and the ultimate critical judgment which 
concerns the objective merits of the work. 
Let me restate the maxims, then, in the following manner. Before you express your likes 
and dislikes, you must first be sure that you have made an honest effort to appreciate the 
work. By appreciation, I mean having the experience which the author tried to produce 
for you by working on your emotions and imaginations. You cannot appreciate a novel 
by reading it passively, any more than you can understand a philosophical book that 
way. To achieve appreciation, as understanding, you must read actively, and that means 
performing all the acts of structural and analytical reading which I have briefly outlined. 
After you have completed such readings, you are competent to judge. Your first 
judgment will naturally be one of taste. You will say not only that you like or dislike the 
book, but why you did or did not like it. The reasons you give will, of course, have some 
critical relevance to the book itself, but in their first expression they are more likely to 
be about you！your preferences and prejudices！than about the book. Hence, to 
complete the task of criticism, you must objectify your reactions by pointing to those 
things in the book which caused them. You must pass from saying what you like or 
dislike and why, to saying what is good or bad about the book and why. 
There is a real difference here. No one can disagree with a man about what he likes or 
dislikes. The absolute authority of his own taste is every man's prerogative. But others 
can disagree with him about whether a book is good or bad. Taste may not be arguable, 
but critical appraisals can be assailed and defended. We must appeal to principles of 
esthetic or literary criticism if we wish to support our critical judgments. 
It the principles of literary criticism were firmly established, and generally agreed on, it 
would be easy to enumerate briefly the main critical remarks that a reader could make 
about an imaginative hook. Unfortunately！ or fortunately！that is not the case, and 
you will sympathize with my discretion in hesitating to rush in. I shall, however, risk 
suggesting five questions which will help anyone form a critical judgment on fiction, (i) 
To what degree does the work have unity? (2) How great is the complexity of parts and 
elements which that unity embraces and organizes? (3) Is it a likely story, that is, does it 
have the inherent plausibility of poetic truth? (4) Does it elevate you from the ordinary 
semiconsciousness of daily life to the clarity of intense wakefulness, by stirring your 
emotions and filling your imagination? (5) Does it create a new world into which you 
are drawn and wherein you seem to live with the illusion that you are seeing life steadily 
and whole? 

I shall not defend these questions beyond saying that the more they can be answered 
affirmatively, the more likely it is that the book in question is a great work of art. I think 
they will help you to discriminate between good and bad fiction, as well as to become 
more articulate in explaining your likes and dislikes. Although you must never forget 
the possible discrepancy between what is good in itself and what pleases you, you will 
be able to avoid the extreme inanity of the remark: "I don't know anything about art, but 
I know what I like." 
The better you can reflectively discern the causes of your pleasure in reading fiction, the 
nearer you come to knowing the artistic virtues in the literary work itself. You will thus 
gradually develop a standard of criticism. And unless you happen to be a professional 
literary critic！tortured by the need to express the same few insights differently for 
every book, and driven by competition to avoid the obvious！you will find a large 
company of men of similar taste to share your critical judgments. You may even 
discover, what I think is true, that good taste in\ literature is acquired by anyone who 
learns to read. 
 - 4 - 
Having gone so far toward generalizing the art of reading, by translating the expository 
rules into their fictional equivalents, I am impelled to take the last step and complete the 
job. You now have rules for reading any book. But how about rules for reading anything 
that is fit to print? How about reading newspapers, magazines, advertising copy, 
political propaganda? Can the rules be stated so generally that they apply to everything? 
I think they can. Necessarily, as they become more general, the rules become fewer in 
number and less specific in content. In place of three sets of rules, each including three 
or four, the directions for reading anything can be summarized in tour questions. To 
read anything well, you must be able to answer these four questions about it. In the light 
of all the discussion that has preceded, the questions need little explanation. You 
already know the steps you must take in order to answer these questions. 
But, first, let me remind you of the basic distinction！ between reading tor information 
and for understanding！ which underlies everything I have said about reading. For the 
most part, we read newspapers and magazines, and even advertising matter, tor the 
information they contain. The amount of such material is vast, so vast that no one today 
has time to read more than a small fraction of the available sources of information. 
Necessity has been the mother of several good inventions in the field of such reading. 
The so-called news magazines, such as Time and Newsweek, perform an invaluable 
function for most of us by reading the news and reducing it to its essential elements of 
information. The men who write these magazines are pri marily readers. They have 
developed the art of reading for information to a point far beyond the average reader's 
competence. 
The same thing is true of Readers Digest, which manages to reduce almost everything 
that is worth our attention in current magazines to the compact scope of a single, small 
volume. Of course, the very best articles, like the best books, cannot be condensed 
without loss. If the essays of Montaigne or Lamb appeared in a current periodical, we 
would scarcely be satisfied to read a digest of them. A summary here would function 
well only if it impelled us to read the original. For the average article, however, a 
condensation is usually adequate, and often even better than the original. because the 
average article is mainly informational. The skill which produces Readers Digest each 
month is, first of all, a skill in reading, and only then one of writing simply and clearly. 
It does for us what few of us have the technique ！not merely the time！to do for 

ourselves. It cuts the core of solid information out of pages and pages of less substantial 
stuff. 
But, after all, we still have to read the periodicals which accomplish these extraordinary 
digests of current news and information. If we wish to be informed, we cannot avoid the 
task of reading, no matter how good the digests are. And the task of reading the digests 
is, in the last analysis, the same task as that which is performed by the editors of these 
magazines on the original materials they make available in more compact form. They 
have saved us labor, so far as the extent of our reading is concerned, but they have not 
and cannot entirely save us the trouble of reading. In a sense, the function they perform 
profits us only if we can read their digests of information as well as they have done the 
prior reading in order to give us the digests. 
The four questions I shall now state as guides tor reading anything apply equally to 
material which can inform us or enlighten us. To use these questions intelligently as a 
set of directions, you must know, of course, what it is you are after！whether you are 
reading for one purpose or the other. If you are wise, your purpose will accord properly 
with the nature of the thing to be read. Here are the four questions, with brief comment: 
I. What in general is being said? (To answer this question, you must perform all the 
steps of structural reading, according to the rules already laid down.) 
II. How in partocular is it being said? (you Cannot fully discover what is being said 
unless you penetrate beneath the language to the thought. To do this you must observe 
how the language is being used, and how the thought is ordered. Here, then, you must 
follow all the rules of interpretative reading.) 
III. Is it true? (Only after you know what is being said, and how, can you consider 
whether it is true or probable. This question calls for the exercise of critical judgment. 
You must decide to accept or reject the information being offered you. You must be 
especially alert to detect the distortions of propaganda in renderings of the news. In 
reading for enlightenment, you must decide whether you agree or disagree with what 
you have come to understand. The rules you must follow here are those of the third, or 
critical, reading.) 
IV. What of it? (Unless what you have read is true in some sense, you need go no 
further. But if it is, you must face this question. You cannot read for information 
intelligently without determining what significance is, or should be, attached to the facts 
presented. Facts seldom come to us without some interpretation, explicit or implied. 
This is especially true if you are reading digests of information which necessarily select 
the facts according to some evaluation of their significance, some principle of 
interpretation. And if you are reading for enlightenment, there is really no end to the 
inquiry which, at every stage of learning, is renewed by the question, What of it?) 
 
These four questions summarize all the obligations of a reader. The first three indicate, 
moreover, why there are three ways of reading anything. The three sets of rules re spond 
to something in the very nature of human discourse. If communications were not 
complex, structural analysis would be unnecessary. If language were a perfect medium 
instead of a relatively opaque one, there would be no need for interpretation. If error and 
ignorance did not circumscribe truth and knowledge, we should not have to be critical. 
The fourth question turns on the distinction between Information and understanding. 
When the material you have read is itself primarily informational, you are challenged to 

go further and seek enlightenment. Even when you have been somewhat enlightened by 
what you have read, you are called upon to continue the search for significance. 
Knowing these questions is, of course, not enough. You must remember to ask them as 
you read and, most of all, you must be able to answer them precisely and accurately. 
The ability to do just that is the art of reading, in a nutshell. 
 - 5 - 
Ability to read anything well may be the goal, but the goal does not indicate the best 
place to begin acquiring the art. You cannot begin to acquire the right habits by reading 
any sort of material; perhaps I should say that some kinds of material make it easier to 
acquire the discipline than others. It is too easy, for instance, to get something out of 
newspapers, magazines, and digests, even when one reads them poorly and passively. 
Moreover, all our bad habits of perfunctory reading are associated with these familiar 
materials. That is why, throughout this book, I insisted that trying to read for 
understanding rather than information！because more difficult and less usual！provides 
you with a better occasion tor developing your skill. 
For the same reason, reading good books, or better, the great books, is the recipe for 
those who would learn to read. It is not that the rigors of difficult reading are the 
punishment which fits the crime of sloppy habits; rather, from the point of view of 
therapy, books which cannot be understood at all unless they are read actively are the 
ideal prescription for anyone who is still a victim of passive reading. Nor do I think that 
this medicine is like those drastic and strenuous remedies which are calculated either to 
kill or cure the patient. For in this case, the patient can determine the dosage. He can 
increase the amount of exercise he takes in easy stages. The remedy will begin to work 
as soon as he begins ind the more it works, the more he can take. 
The place to begin, then, is on the great books. They are so apt tor the purpose, it is 
almost as if they were written for the sake of teaching people how to read. They stand to 
the problem of learning how to read almost as water does to the business of learning 
how to swim. There is one important difference. Water is indispensable for swimming. 
But after you have learned to read by practicing on the great books, you can transfer 
your abilities to reading good books, to reading any books, to reading anything. The 
man who) can keep afloat in the deeps need not concern himseif about the shallows. 
ut why you did or did not like it. The reasons you give will, of course, have some critical 
relevance to the book itself, but in their first expression they are more likely to be about 
you！your preferences and prejudices！than about the book. Hence, to complete the 
task of criticism, you must objectify your reactions by pointing to those things in the 
book which caused them. You must pass from saying what you like or dislike and why, 
to saying what is good or bad about the book and why. 
There is a real difference here. No one can disagree with a man about what he likes or 
dislikes. The absolute authority of his own taste is every man's prerogative. But others 
can disagree with him about whether a book is good or bad. Taste may not be arguable, 
but critical appraisals can be assailed and defended. We must appeal to principles of 
esthetic or literary criticism if we wish to support our critical judgments.

would be easy to enumerate briefly the main critical remarks that a reader could make

I. What in general is being said? (To answer this question, you must perform all the 
steps of structural reading, according to the rules already laid down.) 
II. How in partocular is it being said? (you Cannot fully discover what is being said 
unless you penetrate beneath the language to the thought. To do this you must observe 
how the language is being used, and how the thought is ordered. Here, then, you must 
follow all the rules of interpretative reading.) 
III. Is it true? (Only after you know what is being said, and how, can you consider 
whether it is true or probable. This question calls for the exercise of critical judgment. 
You must decide to accept or reject the information being offered you. You must be 
especially alert to detect the distortions of propaganda in renderings of the news. In 
reading for enlightenment, you must decide whether you agree or disagree with what 
you have come to understand. The rules you must follow here are those of the third, or 
critical, reading.) 
IV. What of it? (Unless what you have read is true in some sense, you need go no 
further. But if it is, you must face this question. You cannot read for information 
intelligently without determining what significance is, or should be, attached to the facts 
presented. Facts seldom come to us without some interpretation, explicit or implied. 
This is especially true if you are reading digests of information which necessarily select 
the facts according to some evaluation of their significance, some principle of 
interpretation. And if you are reading for enlightenment, there is really no end to the 
inquiry which, at every stage of learning, is renewed by the question, What of it?) 

These four questions summarize all the obligations of a reader. The first three indicate, 
moreover, why there are three ways of reading anything. The three sets of rules re spond 
to something in the very nature of human discourse. If communications were not 
complex, structural analysis would be unnecessary. If language were a perfect medium 
instead of a relatively opaque one, there would be no need for interpretation. If error and 
ignorance did not circumscribe truth and knowledge, we should not have to be critical. 
The fourth question turns on the distinction between Information and understanding. 
When the material you have read is itself primarily informational, you are challenged to 
go further and seek enlightenment. Even when you have been somewhat enlightened by 
what you have read, you are called upon to continue the search for significance. 
Knowing these questions is, of course, not enough. You must remember to ask them as 
you read and, most of all, you must be able to answer them precisely and accurately. 
The ability to do just that is the art of reading, in a nutshell. 
 - 5 - 
Ability to read anything well may be the goal, but the goal does not indicate the best 
place to begin acquiring the art. You cannot begin to acquire the right habits by reading 
any sort of material; perhaps I should say that some kinds of material make it easier to 
acquire the discipline than others. It is too easy, for instance, to get something out of 
newspapers, magazines, and digests, even when one reads them poorly and passively. 
Moreover, all our bad habits of perfunctory reading are associated with these familiar 
materials. That is why, throughout this book, I insisted that trying to read for 
understanding rather than information！because more difficult and less usual！provides 
you with a better occasion tor developing your skill. 
For the same reason, reading good books, or better, the great books, is the recipe for 
those who would learn to read. It is not that the rigors of difficult reading are the 
punishment which fits the crime of sloppy habits; rather, from the point of view of 
therapy, books which cannot be understood at all unless they are read actively are the 
ideal prescription for anyone who is still a victim of passive reading. Nor do I think that 
this medicine is like those drastic and strenuous remedies which are calculated either to 
kill or cure the patient. For in this case, the patient can determine the dosage. He can 
increase the amount of exercise he takes in easy stages. The remedy will begin to work 
as soon as he begins ind the more it works, the more he can take. 
The place to begin, then, is on the great books. They are so apt tor the purpose, it is 
almost as if they were written for the sake of teaching people how to read. They stand to 
the problem of learning how to read almost as water does to the business of learning 
how to swim. There is one important difference. Water is indispensable for swimming. 
But after you have learned to read by practicing on the great books, you can transfer 
your abilities to reading good books, to reading any books, to reading anything. The 
man who) can keep afloat in the deeps need not concern himseif about the shallows. 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
The Great Books 
As I noted in the Preface, it was necessary to revise this chapter to make it fit the new 
Appendix to this edition of How to Read a Book. However, the chapter is not as 
radically revised as it might have been. Let me explain why. 
This chapter was originally intended to introduce the recommended great books that 
were listed in the Appendix. It discussed the character of great books in general, and set 
forth the criteria by which we can tell whether a book is truly great. It went on to show, 
by the use of examples, how these books take part in a great conversation！how they 
are interwoven in the fabric of our thought. The revised chapter still does that, except 
that I have changed the examples to fit the books and authors listed in the new 
Appendix. 
Since I wrote the original chapter, however, remarkable advances have occurred in the 
reading and the discussion of great books. I have called attention to these changes in the 
Preface to this edition. The publication and distribution of Great Books of the Western 
World and of Gateway to the Great Books is largely responsible tor them. The existence 
of these sets, and particularly the existence of the Syntopicon, has also radically altered 
the context of this chapter, in two ways. 
Volume i of Great Books of the Western World contains as essay by Robert M. 
Hutchins, titled "The Great Conversation." Here Mr. Hutchins says, at greater length 
and with much more force and eloquence, everything that I said about the character of 
great books in my original Chapter 16, and he describes the interplay of these books 
with one another better than I could ever hope to do. From one point of view, therefore, 
I need not really revise this chapter at all. The essay that I would like it to be has been 
written by Mr. Hutchins. 
The existence of the Syntopicon is an even more important reason why I have not 
attempted to revise this chapter more than superficially. The Syntopicon, with its vast 
number of references to the great books, by idea, topic, and subtopic, makes' it possible 
to read them in an entirely new way. In the Preface to the Syntopicon (pages xi-xxxi of 
Volume 2 in Great Books of the Western World), I describe this new way of reading, 
which I call "syntopical reading," and which consists of "reading in" the whole set of 
great books as contrasted with "reading through" a single work. Hence I would only 
have repeated here, with less space at my disposal, what I said there. 
Finally, I have discovered on reading this chapter again after many years, that its 
discussion of how to read great books without the Syntopicon is revealing about the 
Syntopicon itself. Twenty-five years ago, I could not even hope that the kind of reading 
that the Syntopicon makes possible would ever be available. (I had dreamed of the 
Syntopicon, but I did not then think it would ever be a reality.) Now, looking back, I see 
even more clearly how useful and powerful a tool the Syntopicon is. Reading great 
books without its help is an intellectual experience hardly to be equaled in the world of 
thought. But reading them with it as a guide is even more rewarding. I hope the reader 
will see this when he peruses this chapter, and will forgive me, too, for leaving it to 
stand as an obvious anachronism！for the sake of his education. 

- 1 - 
there is no end to the making of books. Nor does there seem to be any end to the making 
of book lists. The one is the cause of the other. There have always been more books 
than anyone could read. And as they have multiplied at an ever increasing rate through 
the centuries, more and more blue-ribbon lists have had to be made. 
It is just as important to know what to read as how to read. When you have learned to 
read, you will still have, I hope, a long life to spend in reading. But, at best, you will be 
able to read only a few books of all that have been written, and the few you do read 
should include the best. You can rejoice in the fact that there are not too many great 
books to read. There are fifty-four volumes in Great Books of the Western World！tern 
hundred and forty-five works by seventy-tour authors. 
The listing of the best books is as old as reading and writing. The teachers and librarians 
of ancient Alexandria did it. Their book lists were the backbone of an educational 
curriculum. Quintilian did it for Roman education, selecting, as he said, both ancient 
and modern classics. It was done again and again in the Middle Ages by 
Mohammedans, Jews, and Christians, and for a similar purpose. In the Renaissance, 
such leaders of the revival of learning as Montaigne and Erasmus made lists of the 
books they read. They offered themselves as models of gentlemanly literacy. 
Humanistic education was built on a foundation of "humane letters," as the phrase went. 
The reading prescribed was primarily in the great works of Roman literature！its 
poetry, biography, and history, and its moralistic essays. 
In the nineteenth century, there were still other book lists. If you want to know the 
books which went into the making of a leading liberal of his day, look at John Stuart 
Mill's Autobiography. Perhaps the most famous book list made in the last century was 
Auguste Comte's. Comte was the French thinker who epitomized the nineteenth 
century's devotion to science and to progress through science. 
It is to be expected, of course, that the selection of "best books" will change with the 
times. Yet there is a surprising uniformity in the lists that represent the best choices of 
any period. In^very age, both b.c. and a.d., the list makers include both ancient and 
modern books in their selections, and they always wonder whether the modems are up 
to the great books of the past. The changes which each later age makes are mainly 
additions rather than substitutions. Naturally, the list of great books grows in the course 
of time, but its roots and outlines remain the same. 
The reason for this is that the famous lists are genuinely many-sided. They try to include 
all that is great in the human tradition. A bad selection would be one motivated by a 
sectarian bias, directed by some kind of special pleading. There have been lists of this 
sort, which picked only the books that would prove a certain point. The European 
tradition cannot be boxed that way. It includes much that must necessarily appear false 
or misguided when judged from any particular point of view. Wherever one finds the 
truth, there will always be great errors in its company. To list the great books 
adequately, one must include all that have made a difference, not simply those one 
agrees with or approves of. 
Until sixty or seventy years ago, a college course was built around a set of required 
readings. Under the impact of the elective system and other educational changes, the 
requirements in this country were gradually relaxed to a point where the bachelor's 
degree no longer meant general literacy. The great books still appeared here and there, 

in this course and that, but they were seldom read in relation to one another. Frequently 
they were made supplementary to the textbooks which dominated the curriculum. 
Things were at their worst when I entered college at the start o♀ the twenties. As I have 
already reported, I also saw the upward turn begin. John Erskine had persuaded the 
Columbia faculty to institute an Honors course, devoted to the reading of great books. 
The list, which he was largely instrumental in composing, included between sixty and 
seventy authors, representing all fields of learning and all kinds of poetry. It differed 
from other current selections by having a higher standard of choice, and also by trying 
to include every great book, not only those of a certain period or a certain kind. 
The Erskine list has been modified and revised many times since its inception. Mr. 
Hutchins and I have used it with some alterations at the University of Chicago. The 
four-year program of reading at St. John's College is substantially the same list, though 
it has been enriched by additions from the fields of mathematics and natural science. A 
similar list, though somewhat shorter, is being used at many colleges now in courses 
required tor all students. And the list of Great Books of the Western World, 
supplemented by Gateway to the Great Books, is a fairly accurate expression of what 
anyone would name as the great works of Western culture. 
I had one experience which gave me insight into this business of listing the great books. 
I acted as secretary tor the faculty which taught the Honors course at Columbia during 
the years when the original list was being revised. Various members of the faculty had 
expressed dissatisfaction. They wanted to drop some authors and include others. To 
settle matters, we constructed a master list of about three hundred books, many more 
than anyone would wish included, but long enough to contain any author anyone might 
name. 
We then proceeded to vote, gradually excluding the books or authors which the voting 
indicated as not generally agreed on. After many ballots, we obtained a list which 
satisfied everyone. It had eighty items on it, only about fifteen more than Erskine's 
enumeration. It contained almost all the titles on the original list. From those two years 
of revision, I learned the extent to which there is unanimity of judgment about the great 
books. It became clear that it would be difficult to make a list much longer than a 
hundred authors about whom such universal agreement could be obtained. When you 
get beyond that, you would be catering to the interests of specialists in this period or 
that subject matter. Our experience was similar when we constructed the list of Great 
Books of the Western World. 
Strictly speaking, a catalogue is not something to read. It is for reference purposes. That 
is why I have listed the contents of Great Books and of Gateway in the Appendix. In 
this chapter, I am going to try to make that list come to life by talking about the books. 
I shall try, therefore, to collect the great books into smaller groups, each group 
participating in a conversation about some particular problem in which you may be 
already interested. In some cases, the conversations will overlap, as the problems do. In 
other cases, conversation about one problem will lead to another. Thus, instead of lying 
side by side in a graveyard row, the books may appear to you as they should！the lively 
actors in a living tradition. I will not name all the books in this chapter, but I shall be 
able to bring enough of them into conversation with one another, so that you can 
imagine the job completed. If you are induced to join in the conversation by reading 
some of these books, they will take care of the rest. 

- 2 - 
Before I begin, however, it may be wise to say a little more about what a great book is. I 
have used the phrase again and again, hoping that what I said in Chapter Four a-bout 
great books as original communications would suffice for the time. In Chapter Eight, I 
suggested that among poetical works there was a parallel distinction. Just as great 
expository books are those which, more than others, can increase our understanding, so 
the great works of imaginative literature elevate our spirit and deepen our humanity. 
In the course of other chapters, I may have mentioned other qualities which the great 
books possess. But now I want to bring together in one place all the signs by which the 
great books can be recognized！repeating some, adding new ones. These are the signs 
which everyone uses in making lists or selections. 
(1) I used to say jocularly that the great books were those everybody recommends and 
nobody reads, or those everyone says he intends to read and never does. The joke (it is 
Mark Twain's, really) may have its point for some of our contemporaries, but the 
remark is false for the most part. In fact, the great books are probably the most widely 
read. They are not best sellers for a year or two. They are enduring best sellers. James 
Bond has had relatively few readers compared to Don Quixote or the plays of 
Shakespeare. It would be reasonable to estimate, as a recent writer did, that Homer's 
Iliad has been read by at least 25,000,000 people in the last 3,000 years. When you 
realize the number of languages into which these books have been translated, and the 
number of years during which they have been read, you will not think that a number of 
readers running high into the millions is exaggerated. 
It does not follow, of course, that every book which reaches a tremendous audience 
ranks as a classic by reason of that fact alone. Three Weeks, Quo Vadis, and Ben-Hur, to 
mention only fiction, are cases in point. Nor do I mean that a great book need be a best 
seller in its own day. It may take time for it to accumulate its ultimate audience. The 
astronomer Kepler, whose work on the planetary motions is now a classic, is reported to 
have said of his book that "it may wait a century for a reader, as God has waited 6,000 
years for an observer." 
(2) The great books are popular, not pedantic. They are not written by specialists about 
specialties for specialists. Whether they be philosophy or science, or history or poetry, 
they treat of human, not academic, problems. They are written for men, not professors. 
When I say they are popular, I do not mean they are popularizations in the sense of 
simplifying what can be found in other books. I mean they were initially written for a 
popular audience. They were intended for beginners. This, as I pointed out earlier, is a 
consequence of their being original communications. With respect to what these books 
have to say, most men are beginners. 
To read a textbook for advanced students, you have to read an elementary textbook first. 
But the great books arc all elementary. They treat the elements of any subject matter. 
They are not related to one another as a series o♀ textbooks, graded in difficulty or in 
the technicality o♀ the problems with which they deal. That is what I meant by saying 
that they are all for beginners, even though they do not all begin at the same place in the 
tradition of thought. There is one kind of prior reading, however, which does help you 
to read a great book, and that is the other great books the author himself read. If you 
begin where he began, you are better prepared tor the new departure he is going to 
make. This is the point I suggested before, when I said that even the mathematical and 
scientific books can be read without special instruction. 

Let me illustrate this point by taking Euclid's Elements of Geometry and Newton's 
Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Euclid requires no prior study of 
mathematics. His book is genuinely an introduction to geometry, and to basic arithmetic 
as well. The same cannot be said for Newton, because Newton uses mathematics in the 
solution of physical problems. The reader must be able to follow his mathematical 
reasoning in order to understand how it interprets his observations. Newton had 
mastered Euclid. His mathematical style shows how deeply he was influenced by 
Euclid's treatment of ratio and proportions. His book is, therefore, not readily 
intelligible, even to competent scientists, unless Euclid has been read before. But with 
Euclid as a guide, the effort to read Newton, or Galileo, ceases to be fruitless. 
I am not saying that these great scientific books can be read without effort. I am saying 
that it they are read in an historical order, the effort is rewarded. Just as Euclid 
illuminates Newton and Galileo, so they in turn help to make Faraday and Einstein 
intelligible. The point is not limited to mathematical and scientific works. It applies to 
philosophical books as well. Their authors tell you what you should have read before 
you come to them: Dewey wants you to have read Mill and Hume; Whitehead wants 
you to have read Descartes and Plato. 
(3) The great books are always contemporary. In contrast, the books we call 
"contemporary," because they are currently popular, last only for a year or two, or ten at 
the most. They soon become antiquated. You probably cannot recall the names of the 
best sellers of the fifties. If they were recalled for you, you probably would not be 
interested in reading them. Especially in the field of nonfiction books, you want the 
latest "contemporary" product. But the great books are never outmoded by the 
movement of thought or the shitting winds of doctrine and opinion. On the contrary, one 
great book tends to intensify the significance of others about the same subject. Thus, 
Marx's Capital and Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations illuminate each other, and so do 
works as far apart as Claude Bernard's Introduction to Experimental Medicine and the 
medical writings of Hippocrates and Galen. 
Schopenhauer said this clearly. "Looking over a huge catalogue of new books," he said, 
"one might weep at thinking that, when ten years have passed, not one of them will be 
heard of." His further explanation is worth following: 
There are at all times two literatures in progress, running side by side, but little known 
to each other; the one real, the other only apparent. The former grows into permanent 
literature; it is pursued by those who live for science or poetry; its course is sober and 
quiet, but extremely slow; 
and it produces in Europe scarcely a dozen works in a century; these, however, are 
permanent. The other kind is pursued by persons who live on science and poetry. It goes 
at a gallop, with much noise and shouting of partisans. Every twelve-month it puts a 
thousand works on the market. But after a few years one asks. Where are they? Where is 
the glory which came so soon and made so much clamor? This kind may be called 
fleeting, and the other, permanent literature. 
"Permanent" and "fleeting" are good words to name the persistently contemporary great 
books and the soon antiquated current ones. 
Because they are contemporary, and should be read as such, the word "classic" must be 
avoided. Mark Twain, you will recall, defined a classic as "something that everybody 
wants to have read, and nobody wants to read." I am afraid not even that is true for most 
people any longer. "Classic" has come to mean an ancient and antiquated book. People 

regard the classics as the great has-beens, the great books of their times. "But our times 
are different," they say. From this point of view, the only motive for reading the classics 
is an historical or philological interest. It is like poking about among the somewhat 
moldy monuments of a past culture. The classics, thus viewed, cannot offer instruction 
to a modern man, except, of course, about the peculiarities of his ancestors. 
But the great books are not faded glories. They are not dusty remains for scholars to 
investigate. They are not a record of dead civilizations. They are rather the most potent 
civilizing forces in the world today. 
Of course, there is progress in some things. There is progress in all the utilities which 
man can invent to make the motions of life easier and more efficient. There is progress 
in social affairs, of the sort signalized by the advent of democracy in modern times. And 
there is progress in knowledge and the clarification of problems and ideas. 
But there is not progress in everything. The fundamental human problems remain the 
same in all ages. Anyone who reads Plutarch and Cicero, or, if you prefer, the essays of 
Bacon and Montaigne, will find how constant is the preoccupation of men with 
happiness and justice, with virtue and truth, and even with stability and change itself. 
We may succeed in accelerating the motions of life, but we cannot seem to change the 
routes that are available to its ends. 
It is not only in moral or political matters that progress is relatively superficial. Even in 
theoretic knowledge, even in science and philosophy, where knowledge increases and 
understanding may be deepened, the advances made by every epoch are laid upon a 
traditional foundation. Civilization grows like an onion, layer upon layer. To understand 
Einstein, you must, as he tells you himself, understand Galileo and Newton. To 
understand Whitehead, you must, as he also tells you, know Descartes and Plato. It any 
contemporary books are great because they deal with fundamental matters, then all the 
great books are contemporary because they are involved in the same discussion. 
(4) The great books are the most readable. I have said this before. It means several 
things. If the rules of skilled reading are somehow related to the rules of skillful writing, 
then these are the best-written books. If a good reader is proficient in the liberal arts, 
how much more so is a great writer a master of them! These books are masterpieces of 
liberal art. In saying this, I refer primarily to expository works. The greatest works of 
poetry or fiction are masterpieces of fine art. In both cases, language is mastered by the 
writer for the sake of the reader, whether the end be instruction or delight. 
To say that the great books are most readable is to say that they will not let you down it 
you try to read them well. You can follow the rules of reading to your utmost ability and 
they, unlike poorer works, will not stop paying dividends. But it is equally true to say 
that there is actually more in them to read. It is not merely how they are written, but 
what they have to say. They have more ideas per page than most books have in their 
entirety. That is why you can read a great book over and over again and never exhaust 
its contents, and probably never read skillfully enough to master it completely. The 
most readable books are infinitely readable. 
They are rereadable for another reason. They can be read at many different levels of 
understanding, as well as with a great diversity of interpretation. The most obvious 
examples of many levels of reading are found in such books as Gulliver's Travels, 
Robinson Crusoe, and The Odyssey. Children can read them with enjoyment, but fail to 
find therein all the beauty and significance which delight an adult mind. 

(5) I have also said before that the great books are the 
most instructive, the most enlightening. This follows, in a sense, from the tact that they 
are original communications, that they contain what cannot be found in other books. 
Whether you ultimately agree or disagree with their doctrines, these are the primary 
teachers of mankind, because they have made the basic contributions to human learning 
and thought. Insofar as they have solved important problems, wholly or partially, the 
principles to be found in them are the leading principles of human knowledge. And^the 
conclusions their authors reached are the major achievements of human thought. 
It is almost unnecessary to add that the great books are the most influential books. In the 
tradition of learning, they have been most discussed by readers who have also been 
writers. These are the books about which there are many other books. Countless and, for 
the most part, forgotten are the books which have been written about them ！the 
commentaries, digests, or popularizations. 
(6) Finally, the great books deal with the persistently unsolved problems of human life. 
It is not enough to say of them that they have solved important problems, in whole or in 
part！that is only one aspect of their achievement. There are genuine mysteries in the 
world that mark the limits of human knowing and thinking. Inquiry not only begins with 
wonder, but usually ends with it also. 
Great minds do not, like shallower ones, despise mysteries or run away from them. 
They acknowledge them honestly and try to define them by the clearest statement of 
ultimately imponderable alternatives. Wisdom is fortified, not destroyed, by 
understanding its limitations. Ignorance does not make a fool as surely as self-
deception. 
 - 3 - 
You can see now how these six criteria hang together, how they follow from and 
support one another. You can see why, if these are the qualifications, the exclusive 
society of great authors has fewer than four hundred members. 
Perhaps you can also see why you should read the great books rather than books about 
them or books which try to distill them for you. "Some books," says Francis Bacon, 
"may be read by deputy, and extracts made o♀ them by others. But that would be only in 
the less important arguments, and the meaner sort o♀ books." With respect to the others, 
"distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things." The same reason 
which sends men to the concert hall and the art gallery should send them to the great 
books rather than to imperfect reproductions. The firsthand witness is always preferred 
to garbled hearsay. A good story can be spoiled by a bad raconteur. 
The only excuse which men have ever given tor reading books about these books does 
not hold here any more than it would in the case of canned music or cheap replicas of 
painting and sculpture. They know that it is easier, as well as better, to meet the fine 
artist in his own work rather than in its imitations. But they believe that the great 
teachers cannot be met in their own works. They think they are too difficult, too far 
above them, and hence they console themselves with substitutes. This, as I have tried to 
show, is not the case. I repeat: the great books are the most readable tor anyone who 
knows how to read. Skill in reading is the only condition for entry into this good 
company. 

Please do not look at the list of great books as another of those lists which men make up 
tor the lonely island on which they are going to be shipwrecked. You do not need the 
idyllic solitude, which modern men can dream of only as the benefit of disaster, in order 
to read the great books. If you have any leisure at all, you can use it to read in. But do 
not make the mistake of the businessman who devotes every energy to making his pile 
first, and supposes that he will know how to use his spare time when he retires. Leisure 
and work should be components of every week, not divisions of (he span of life. 
The pursuit of learning and enlightenment through the great books can relieve the 
tedium of toil and the monotony of business as much as music and the other fine arts. 
But the leisure must be genuinely leisure. It must be time free from the children and 
from television, as well as un-'pccupied by money grubbing. Not only is the widely 
advertised fifteen minutes a day ridiculously insufficient！would anyone interested in 
golf or bridge think that fifteen minutes are long enough even to warm up and get 
started?！ but the time spent in reading must not be shared with bouncing Teddy on 
your knee, answering Mary's questions, or watching the cops catch the robbers. 
There is one point, however, in the selection of books men make for a possible 
shipwreck. When they are faced with having to choose a very small number, they tend 
to pick the best. We forget that the total amount of leisure we can rescue from our busy 
lives is probably no longer than a few years on a desert island. If we realized that, we 
might make up a list of reading for the rest of our lives as carefully as we would for a 
desert island. We cannot count on eternity. The bell will ring soon enough. School will 
be out, and unless we have laid our plans well and followed them, we are likely to find, 
when reading time is over, that we might just as well have played golf or bridge, for all 
the good it did our minds. 
The list of Great Books in the Appendix is a suggestion for those who can take the hint. 
It is neither too long for the average man's leisure nor too short for those who can 
manage to find more time. However much of it you do, I am sure of one thing: no time 
will be wasted. Whether your economy be one of abundance or scarcity, you will find 
every item on this list a profitable investment of hours and energy. 
 - 4 - 
I said before that I was going to make smaller groupings of books according as their 
authors appeared to be talking about the same problems and conversing with one 
another. Let's begin at once. The easiest way to begin is with the themes that dominate 
our daily conversation. The newspapers and television will not let us forget about the 
world crisis and our national role in it. We talk at table and in the evening, and even 
during office hours, about war and peace, about democracy against the totalitarian 
regimes, about planned economies, about civil rights and Communism, about the next 
national election, and hence about the Constitution, which both parties are going to use 
as a platform and as a plank with which to hit the other fellow over the head. 
It we do more than look at the newspapers or watch television, we may have been 
induced to look at the Constitution itself. It the political problems with which current 
books deal interest us, there is more reading for us to do in relation to them and the 
Constitution. These contemporary authors probably read some of the great books, and 
the men who wrote the Constitution certainly did. All we have to do is to follow the 
lead, and the trail will unwind by itself. 
First, let us go to the other writings of the men who drafted the Constitution. Most 
obvious of all is the collection of pieces, arguing for the ratification of the Constitution, 

published weekly in The Independent Journal and elsewhere by Hamilton, Madison, 
and Jay. To understand The Federalist, you should read not only the Articles of 
Confederation, which the Constitution was intended to supplant, but also the writings of 
the Federalists' major opponent on many issues, Thomas Jefferson. 
George Washington, Edmund Burke, and Tom Paine ^ were other great participants in 
the argument. Washington saw the Constitution as in some sense the leading hope of 
mankind. Burke, an Englishman, supported our Revolution and attacked the one in 
France in 1789. And Paine's works throw light on the issues of the day and the 
ideologies that controlled the opponents. 
These writers, because they were readers as well, lead us to the books which influenced 
them. They are using ideas whose more extended and disinterested exposition is to be 
found elsewhere. The pages of The Federalist, and the writings of Jefferson, Burke, and 
Paine refer us to the great political thinkers of the eighteenth and late seventeenth 
centuries in Europe. We should read Montesquieu's The Spirit of Laws, Locke's essay 
Concerning Civil Government, Rousseau's Social Contract. To savor the rationalism of 
this Age of Reason, we must also read here and there in the voluminous papers of 
Voltaire. 
You may suppose that the laissez-faire individualism of Adam Smith also belongs in 
our revolutionary background, but remember that The Wealth of Nations was first 
published in 1776. The founding fathers were influenced, in their ideas about property, 
agrarianism, and free trade, by John Locke and the French economists against whom 
Adam Smith subsequently wrote. 
Our founding fathers were well read in ancient history. They drew upon the annals of 
Greece and Rome tor many of their political examples. They had read Plutarch's Lives 
and Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War！the war between Sparta and 
Athens and their allies. They followed the fortunes of the various Greek federations for 
what light they might throw on the enterprise they were about to undertake. They were 
not only learned in history and political thought, but they went to school with the 
ancient orators. As a result, their political propaganda is not only magnificently turned, 
but amazingly effective even today. With the exception of Lincoln (who had read a few 
great books very well), American statesmen of a later day neither speak nor write so 
well. 
The trail leads further. The writers of the eighteenth century had been influenced in turn 
by their immediate forebears in political thought. The Leviathan of Thomas Hobbes and 
the political tracts of Spinoza deal with the same problems of government！the 
formation of society by contract, the justifications of monarchy, oligarchy, and 
democracy, the right of rebellion against tyranny. Locke, Spinoza, and Hobbes are, in a 
sense, involved in a conversation with one another. Locke and Spinoza had read 
Hobbes. Spinoza, moreover, had read Machiavelli's The Prince, and Locke everywhere 
refers to and quotes "the judicious Hooker," the Richard Hooker who wrote a book 
about ecclesiastical government at the end of the sixteenth century, and of whom Izaak 
Walton, the fisherman, wrote a life. 
I mention Hooker！even though he is not in either Great Books or Gateway！ because 
he, more than the men of a later generation, had read the ancients well, especially the 
Ethics and Politics of Aristotle. He had certainly read them better than Thomas Hobbes, 
if we can judge^by the references in the latter's work. Hooker's influence on Locke 
partly accounts tor the difference between Locke and Hobbes on many political 
questions. 

Like Locke, Hooker opposed the theory of the divine right of kings. Madison and 
Jefferson were acquainted with his arguments. Through him, still other books entered 
the picture. Hooker reflected the great medieval works on political theory, especially the 
writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, who was an upholder of popular sovereignty and the 
natural rights of man. 
The conversation about current political issues thus enlarges itself to take in the whole 
of European political thought. If we go back to the Constitution and the writings of '76, 
we are inevitably led further, as each writer reveals himself to be a reader in turn. Little 
has been left out. If we add Plato's Republic and Laws which Aristotle read and 
answered, and Cicero's Republic and Laws which were read by Roman jurists, and 
through them influenced the development of law throughout medieval Europe, almost 
all the great political books have been drawn in. 
 - 5 - 
That is not quite true. By returning to the original conversation, and taking a fresh start, 
we may discover the few major omissions. Suppose there is an ex-Nazi in our midst, 
and he quotes Mein Kampf to us. Since it is not clear that Hitler ever read the great 
books, the political utterances of Mussolini might be more productive of leads. We may 
remember that Mussolini was once a socialist. If we pursue these lines in all their 
ramifications, other books inevitably find their way into the conversation. 
There would be Hegel's Philosophy of History and Philosophy of Right. Here we would 
find the justifications of state absolutism, the deification o♀ the state. There would also 
be writings of Carlyle, especially such books as On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the 
Heroic in History. Here we would find the theory of the superman as above the canons 
of right and wrong, the theory of a successful use of might as its own ultimate 
justification. And behind Hegel on the one hand, and Carlyle on the other！in the latter 
case through the influence of Schopenhauer！would be the greatest of German thinkers, 
Immanuel Kant. Anyone who reads Kant's Science of Right will see that he cannot be 
held responsible for the positions of certain of his followers. 
There might also be a Communist at our table, either Khrushchevist or Stalinist. Both 
sorts swear by the same book. The conversation would not get very tar without Karl 
Marx being mentioned. His great work, Capital, would also be mentioned, even though 
no one had read it, not even the Communist. But if anyone had read Capital, and other 
literature of revolution, he would have found a trail which led, on the one hand, to 
Hegel again ！a starting point for both Communism and Fascism！and, on the other 
hand, to the great economic and social theorists of England and France: to Adam 
Smith's Wealth of Nations, to Malthus's essay on Population, and to Guizot's History of 
Civilization in Europe. 
A lawyer present might turn the discussion away from economic theory by turning it to 
the problems of government, and especially those of a democracy. He may have just 
recently read Walter Lippmann's The Public Philosophy. Or he might raise questions 
about the role of the UN in current crises abroad, and refer to Arnold Toyn-bee's 
Civilization on Trial. These books would bring others in their train. 
Becoming interested in the problems of democracy, and of our own democratic 
government in particular, we might go from Lippmann to Alexis de Tocqueville's 
Democracy in America and to Calhoun's Disquisition on Government. The issues both 
of these books raise about the possible tyranny of majority rule and the protection of the 
rights of minorities would lead us to John Stuart Mill's essay on Representative 

Government and to his essay On Liberty. The latter, in turn, especially its magnificent 
chapter on freedom of thought and discussion, would send us to Milton's Areopagitica. 
Mill's two essays, by the way, are being paraphrased every day, with approval or 
disapproval, by men who have not read them, so much have they become a part of the 
contemporary controversy between liberals and conservatives. 
The discussion of Toynbee's views about war and peace and about the role of 
international or supranational organizations in the prevention of war might turn our 
attention to the failure of the league of the ancient Greek cities to prevent the 
Peloponnesian War. Toynbee tells us how much his own views were influenced by 
reading Thucyd-ides' tragic account of that war. The whole subject of war, and 
especially the distinction between the hot war of bombs and battles and the cold war of 
diplomats, propaganda agencies, and spies would probably open up another line of 
reading for us, beginning with von Clausewitz's On War, and going back through Kant's 
little treatise on Perpetual Peace and Rousseau's essay on A Lasting Peace Through the 
Federation of Europe to Dante's thirteenth-century vision o♀ world peace through world 
government, set forth with unassailable logic in the opening book of his De Monarchia. 
Discussions of democracy and government, on the one hand, or of international affairs 
and war and peace, on the other, have a way of getting into thorny questions about the 
intrinsic defects of human nature, and about the intricacies of semantic clarification. The 
question about man's aggressiveness might suggest the reading of Freud's little essay 
Why War? And it we started on that, the whole history of psychology might unfold in 
another list of books, including Pavlov's work Lectures on Conditioned Reflexes, 
William James's Principles of Psychology, Hume's Treatise on Human Nature, 
Descartes' work on The Passions of the Soul, and so on. Since we started out by 
considering the psychological aspects of politics and of war, Machiavelli's The Prince 
would also become relevant, tor it raises the fundamental question about the 
benevolence or malice o♀ men in relation to their fellow men. 
The problem of the meaning of words, and especially the problem of their tricky 
ambiguity, would, of course, lead someone to refer to current books by linguistic 
philosophers of one school or another. All this current literature！and there is a spate of 
it！has deep roots in the tradition of Western thought, from the very beginning in the 
dialogues of Plato and in the treatises of Aristotle, wherein hardly a step is taken 
without attention being paid to the multiple meanings of the critical terms of the 
discussion. If we pursue this interest in the meanings of words and their uses in thought, 
all the great works in the liberal arts would eventually have to be rediscovered. 
A list of required readings would include Locke's Essay on Human Understanding, 
especially Book III on language; Hobbes's Leviathan, especially the first book, and his 
Rhetoric, which closely follows Aristotle's Rhetoric. It would also include Plato's 
dialogues about language and oratory (the Cratylus, Gorgias, and Phaedrus, especially), 
and two great medieval works on teaching and being taught！one by St. Augustine and 
one by St. Thomas, both called Of the Teacher. I dare not start on logical works, 
because the list might be too long, but John Stuart Mill's System of Logic, Bacon's 
Novum Organum, and Aristotle's Or-ganon must be mentioned. 
One other direction is possible. The consideration of political and economic issues tends 
to raise the basic ethical problems about pleasure and virtue, about happiness, the ends 
of life, and the means thereto. Someone may have read Jacques Maritain's Moral 
Philosophy and noticed what this living-follower of Aristotle and Aquinas had to say 
about contemporary problems, especially the moral aspects of current political and 
economic issues. That would not only lead us back to the great moral treatises of the 

past！Aristotle's Ethics and the second part of Aquinas's Summa Theologica！but it 
might also get us into a many-sided dispute. To see it through, we would have to consult 
Mill's Utilitarianism, Kant's Critique of Practical Reason, and Spinoza's Ethics. We 
might even return to the Roman Stoics and Epicureans, to the Meditations of Marcus 
Au-relius, and Lucretius's On the Nature of Things. 
 - 6 - 
You should have observed a number of things in this ramification of conversation or 
reflection about current problems. Not only does one book lead to another, but each 
contains implicitly a large diversity of leads. Our conversation or thought can branch 
out in many directions. and each time it does another group of books seems to be drawn 
in. Notice, furthermore, that the same authors are often represented in different 
connections, tor they have usually written about many of these related topics, sometimes 
in different books, but often in the same work. 
Nor is it surprising that, as one goes back to the medieval and ancient worlds, the same 
names are repeated many times. Aristotle and Plato, Cicero and Aquinas, for instance, 
stand at the fountainhead. They have been read and discussed, agreed with and 
disagreed with by the writers of modern times. And when they have not been read, their 
doctrines have filtered down in many indirect -ways, through such men as Hooker. 
So tar we have dealt mainly with practical matters-politics, economics, morals！
although you probably observed a tendency to become theoretical. We turned to 
psychology by way of Freud's influence on the lawyers. If the ethical controversy had 
been followed a bit further, we would soon have been in metaphysics. In fact, we were, 
with Maritain's discussion of free will and with Spinoza's Ethics. Kant's Critique of 
Practical Reason might have led us to his Critique of Pure Reason, and all the theoretic 
questions about the nature of knowledge and experience. 
Suppose we consider briefly some theoretic questions. We have been concerned with 
education throughout this book. Someone who had read Mr. Hutchins' book. The Higher 
Learning in America, might raise a question about metaphysics and its place in higher 
education. That usually starts a discussion about what metaphysics is. And usually 
someone says there is no such thing. We would probably be referred to John Dewey's 
Democracy and Education and his Quest for Certainty to see that all valid knowledge is 
scientific or experimental. It all the leads therein were followed, we might soon find 
ourselves back to the source of the current anti-metaphysical trend: 
Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, and perhaps even Kant's 
Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics. 
Someone who had read books such as Whitehead's Process and Reality and Science and 
the Modern World, or Santayana's Realm of Essence and Realm of Matter, or Maritain's 
Degrees of Knowledge, might object to the dismissal of metaphysics. The 'protagonist 
might defend the claims of theoretic philosophy to give us knowledge about the nature 
of things, of a different sort and apart from science. It he had read those books well, he 
would have been led back to the great speculative works of modem and ancient times; 
to Descartes' Principles of Philosophy; to Aquinas's little work on Being and Essence; 
to Aristotle's Metaphysics, and to Plato's dialogues, the Timaeus, the Parmenides, and 
the Sophist. 
Or let us suppose that our theoretic interests turn to the natural sciences rather than to 
philosophy. I have already mentioned Freud and Pavlov. The problems'of human 

behavior and human nature open into a lot of other questions. Not only man's nature but 
his place in nature would concern us. All these roads lead to Darwin's Origin of Species 
and thence, on bypaths, to Lyell's Antiquity of Man and Malthus's essay on Population. 
Recently there have been a lot of books about the practice of medicine, and a few about 
the theory of it. Man's normal hypochondria makes him abnormally interested in 
doctors, health, and the functioning of his own body. Here there are many routes in 
reading, but they would all probably go through Claude Bernard's Introduction to 
Experimental Medicine and Harvey's book on The Motion of the Heart, all the way back 
to Galen's Natural Faculties and Hippocrates' amazing formulations of Greek medicine. 
Einstein and Infeld's The Evolution of Physics refers us to the great milestones in the 
development of man's experimental knowledge. Here our reading would be deepened if 
we looked into Poincare's Foundations of Science and Clifford's Common Sense of the 
Exact Sciences. They, in turn, would take us to such works as Faraday's Experimental 
Researches into Electricity and Mendeleev's Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements; 
perhaps even to Newton's Optics, and Galileo's Two New Sciences. 
The most exact sciences are not only the most experimental but also the most 
mathematical ones. If we are interested in physics, we cannot avoid considering 
mathematics. Here, too, there have been many recent books, but I think none so good as 
a little masterpiece by Whitehead called An Introduction to Mathematics. Bertrand 
Russell's various writings on the meaning of mathematics are also worthy of 
consideration. 
If we read these works, we might turn to Forsyth's Mathematics, in Life and Thought. 
From it, we could not help returning to the starting points of modern mathematics in 
Descartes' Geometry and the mathematical works of Newton. Modern commentaries, 
like those of Hogben, Dantzig, and Kasner and Newman, would be extremely helpful, 
but I think we would also find it necessary to see the whole of modern mathematics in 
the light of its contrast with the Greek accomplishment, especially Euclid's Elements of 
Geometry, Nicomachus's Introduction to Arithmetic, and Apollonius's Treatise on 
Conic Sections. 
The connection of the great books and the versatility of their authors may now appear 
even more plainly than before. Descartes and Whitehead were both mathematicians and 
metaphysicians. Malthus's essay on Population was not only a work in social science, 
but also influenced Darwin's notions about the struggle for existence and the survival of 
the fittest. Newton was not only a great experimental physicist but also a great 
mathematician. Leonardo's Notebooks contain both his theory of perspective in painting 
and the record of his mechanical investigations and inventions. 
 - 7 - 
I am going to take one step further. Even though we have been primarily concerned with 
expository works, a recitation of the great books would be sorely deficient if the 
masterpieces of belles-lettres were not mentioned. Here, too, contemporary works might 
generate an interest in their forebears. The modern novel has a varied history which 
opens up when we go back from D. H. Lawrence and Thomas Mann, F. Scott Fitzgerald 
and Ernest Hemingway, to the forms of narration they have tried to modify. These four, 
along with Joseph Conrad, Stephen Crane, and Isaac Singer, lead us to Flaubert, 
Maupassant, and Balzac, and to the great Russians Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. Nor will we 
forget our own Mark Twain, Herman Melville, and Henry James; or Hardy, Dickens, 
and Sir Walter Scott. Behind all these lie the great eighteenth-century novels of Defoe 

and Fielding. Robinson Crusoe and Tom Jones would remind us of many others, 
including Swift's Gulliver. Our travels would not be complete, of course, until we came 
to Cervantes' Don Quixote and Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel. 
The plays, both pleasant and unpleasant, by Shaw and other moderns follow an even 
longer tradition of dramatic writing. There would be not only the plays of Ibsen and 
Chekhov, who influenced Shaw considerably, and the earlier comedies of Sheridan and 
Moliere; but behind the tragedies of Synge and O'Neill, as well as the plays of 
Shakespeare and other Elizabethans, there lie the Greek comedies of Aristophanes and 
the great tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus. 
Finally, there are the long narrative poems, the great epics: Goethe's Faust, Milton's 
Paradise Lost, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dante's Divine Comedy, Virgil's Aeneid, 
and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. 
I have not mentioned all the books and authors in Great Books of the Western World 
and in Gateway to the Great Books, but I have referred to a large number of them as 
they might group themselves in the course of conversation, or in the pursuit of interests 
aroused by contemporary issues or current books. There are no fixed barriers between 
these groups. They flow into one another at every turn. 
This is not only true of such obviously related subject matters as politics and ethics, 
ethics and metaphysics, metaphysics and mathematics, mathematics and natural science. 
It appears in more remote connections. The writers of The Federalist refer to Euclid's 
axioms as a model for political principles. A reader of Montaigne and Machia-velli, as 
well as, of course, of Plutarch, will find their sentiments and stories, even their 
language, in the plays of Shakespeare. The Divine Comedy reflects the Summa The-
ologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle's Ethics, and Ptolemy's astronomy. And we 
know how frequently Plato and Aristotle refer to Homer and the great tragic poets. 
 - 8 - 
Perhaps you see now why I have said so often that the great books should be read in 
relation to one another and in the most varied sorts of connection. Thus read, they 
support each other, illuminate each other, intensify each other's significance. And, of 
course, they make one another more readable. In reciting their names and tracing their 
connections, I have gone backward from contemporary books, taking each step in terms 
of the books an author himself read. That has shown you how the whole tradition of the 
great books is involved in our life today. 
But if you wish to use one great book to help you read another, it would be better to 
read from the past into the present, rather than the other way around. It you first read the 
books an author read, you will understand him better. Your mind has grown as his did, 
and therefore you are better able to come to terms with him, to know and understand 
him. 
To proceed in the other direction is sometimes more exciting. It is more like doing 
detective work, or playing hare and hounds. Even when you get this excitement out of 
reading the books backwards, you will nevertheless have to understand them in the 
forward direction. That is the way they happened, and they can be completely 
understood in no other way. 
Our wanderings among the great books help me to make another point. It is difficult to 
say of any contemporary book that it is great. We are too near it to make a sober 

judgment. Sometimes we can be relatively sure, as in the case of Einstein's work, the 
novels o♀ Proust and Joyce, or the philosophy of Dewey, Whitehead, and Maritain. But, 
for the most part, we must refrain from such elections. The hall of fame is too august a 
place for us to send our twentieth-century candidates, without enclosing return postage. 
But current books can certainly be good, even if we cannot be sure they are great. The 
best sign I know that a current book is good, and that it may even be judged great some 
day, is the obviousness of its connection with the great books. Such books are drawn, 
and draw us, into the conversation which the great books have had. Necessarily their 
authors are well read. They belong to the tradition, whatever they think of it, or however 
much they seem to revolt from it. 
Let me state one further conclusion. We suffer today not only from political nationalism 
but cultural provincialism. We have developed the cult of the present moment. We read 
only current books for the most part, it we read any at all. Not only shall we fail to read 
the good books of this year well, if we read them only, but our failure to read the great 
books isolates us from the world of man, just as much as unqualified allegiance to the 
hammer and sickle makes one a Russian or Chinese first, and a man later！if ever. It is 
our most sacred human privilege to be men first, and citizens or nationals second. This 
is just as true in the cultural sphere as the political. We are not pledged to our country or 
our century. 
It is our privilege, in fact, I would say it is our duty, to belong to the larger brotherhood 
of man which recognizes no national boundaries or any local or tribal fetishes. I do not 
know how to escape from the straitjacket of political nationalism, but I do know how we 
can become citizens of the world of letters, friends of the human spirit in all its 
manifestations, regardless of time and place. 
You can guess the answer. It is by reading the great books. Thus the human mind, 
wherever it is located, can be freed from current emergencies and local prejudices, 
through being elevated to the universal plane of communication. There it grasps the 
general truths, to which the whole human tradition bears witness. 
Those who can read well can think critically. To this extent, they have become free 
minds. If they have read the great books！and I mean really read them！they will have 
the freedom to move anywhere in the human world. Only they can fully lead the life of 
reason who, though living in a time and place, are yet not wholly of it. 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
Free Minds and Free Men 
 - 1 - 
let us not get confused about means and ends. Reading the great books is not for the 
sake of talking about them. Mentioning them by name may give you the appearance of 
literacy, but you do not have to read them to participate in parlor sports or outshine the 
silver at a dinner party. I hope I have made clear that there are better reasons for 
reading！ really reading！the great books. 
So far as conversation is concerned, it is the other way around. I have recommended 
discussion as an aid to reading, not reading for the sake of "brilliant" conversation. The 
conversation between reader and author, which is an integral part of good reading, may 
not take place unless the reader is accustomed to the discussion of books. It he has 

friends with whom he talks about books, he is more likely to talk back to the books 
themselves. 
But there is another and more important point. Even reading the great books well is not 
an end in itself. It is a means toward living a decent human life, the life of a free man 
and a free citizen. This should be our ultimate objective. It is the ultimate theme of this 
book. I shall turn to it at the end of this chapter. For the present, I want to give a little 
more attention to the problem of discussion in relation to reading. 
You can, of course, carry on a conversation with a book alone, but that will seem to 
most people like talking to yourself. For lively conversation, you need more than books 
and the ability to read them. You need friends and the ability to talk and listen. 
Unfortunately, just having friends is not enough. We all have friends. But suppose our 
friends do not like to read books, and do not know how to read and talk about them. 
Suppose they are friends of the golf course or the bridge table, friends of music or of the 
theater, or anything except books. In that case, the kind of conversations I imagined in 
the last chapter will not take place. 
You may have conversations which start in the same way with current topics or recent 
books. Someone recites the newspaper headlines or the latest news broadcast. The big 
news these days is full of problems. It contains the seeds for countless conversations. 
But do they develop? Does the talk leave the level of the newspaper and the radio? If it 
does not, everyone will soon find the conversation dull and, tired of repeating the same 
old stuff, you will decide to play cards, go to the movies, or talk about your neighbors. 
No special literacy is required for that. 
Someone may have read a book, probably one thu Is now being talked about in well-
informed circles. There is another chance for a conversation to begin. But it will falter 
and die away early unless by good luck there happen to be other readers of the same 
book. More likely the others will join in by mentioning other books they have recently 
read. No connections will be made. When everyone has given and taken 
recommendations about the next book to read, the talk will shift to the things people 
think they have in common. Even if several are present who have read the same book, 
the conversation is likely to choke because of their inability to discuss it in a way that 
leads somewhere. 
I may be exaggerating your situation somewhat, but I speak from my own experience of 
too many endlessly dull social evenings. It does not seem as if there were enough people 
who had a common background of reading. It has become fashionable to use the phrase 
"frame of reference." Good conversation requires all those who engage in it to speak 
within the same frame of reference. Communication not only results in something 
common; it usually needs a common background to begin with. Our failures in 
communication are as much due to the lack of an initial community of ideas as to our 
inabilities in talking and listening. 
What I am saying may sound as if it had drastic implications. Not only do I want you to 
learn to read, but now I am asking you to change your friends! I tear there is some truth 
in that. Either you yourself will not change very much, or you must change your friends. 
I am only saying what everyone knows, that friendship depends on a community of 
interests. If you read the great books, you will want friends with whom to discuss them. 
You do not have to find new ones if you can persuade your old ones to read along with 
you. 

I remember what John Erskine said when he launched the group of students I belonged 
to on the reading of the great books. He told us that for some years past he had noticed 
that college students could not talk to one another intelligently. Under the elective 
system, they went to different classes, meeting only now and then and reading only this 
or that textbook in common. Members of the same college year were not intellectual 
friends. When he had gone to Columbia at the beginning of the century, everyone took 
the same courses and read the same books, many of them great ones. Good conversation 
had flourished and, more than that, there had been friendships with respect to ideas as 
well as on the playing field or in fraternities. 
One of his motives in starting the Honors course was to .revive college life as an 
intellectual community. If a group of students read the same books and met weekly for 
two years to discuss them, they might find a new sort of fellowship. The great books 
would not only initiate them into the world of ideas but would provide the frame of 
reference for further communication among them. They would know how to talk 
intelligently and intelligibly to one another, not only about the books, but through the 
books about all the problems which engage men's thought and action. 
In such a community, Erskine said, democracy would be safe, tor democracy requires 
intelligent communication about and common participation in the solution of human 
problems. That was before anyone thought that democracy would ever again be 
threatened. As I remember, we did not pay much attention to Erskine's insight at the 
time. But he was right. I am sure of it now. I am sure that a liberal education is 
democracy's strongest bulwark. 
 - 2 - 
I do not know what chance there is of changing the schools and colleges of this country. 
They are moving in the opposite direction today, away from the three R's and literacy. 
(Paradoxically enough, the current trends in education, which I have criticized, are also 
motivated by a devotion to democracy.) But I do know that something can be done 
about adult education. That is not yet entirely under the control of the teachers' colleges 
and schools of education. You and your friends are free to make plans tor yourself. You 
do not have to wait for someone to come along and offer you a program. You do not 
need any elaborate machinery to set up one. You do not even need any teachers. Get 
together, read the great books, and discuss them. Just as you will learn to read by 
reading, so you will learn to discuss by discussing. 
I have many reasons for thinking this quite feasible. When I went to Chicago and started 
to teach a reading course with President Hutchins, some people in a near-by suburb 
invited me to tell them about it. The group consisted of mature men and women, all of 
them college graduates, some of the men engaged in professional work, some in 
business, many of the women involved in local educational and political activities as 
well as in taking care of their families. They decided they would like to take the course. 
In college we read about sixty books in two years at the rate of one a week. Since the 
suburban group would not have as much time (what with babies and business to occupy 
them), they could only read a book a month. It would take them about eight years, 
therefore, to read the same list of books. Frankly, I did not think they would stick at it. 
At first they read no better than most college graduates do. They were starting from 
scratch, the veneer-thin scratch that a college education leaves. They found that their 
habits of reading, adjusted to the daily paper and even the best periodical or current 
book, were remarkably like no skill at all when they came to read the Iliad, The Divine 
Comedy, or Crime and Punishment; Plato's Republic, Spinoza's Ethics, or Mill's Essay 

on Liberty; Newton's Opticks or Darwin's Origin of Species. But they read them all and 
in the course of doing so they learned how to read. 
They kept at it because they felt their proficiency grow with each year, and enjoyed the 
mastery which skill provides. They can tell now what the author is trying to do, what 
questions he is trying to answer, what his most important concepts are, what reasons he 
has for his conclusions, and even what defects there are in his treatment of the subject. 
The intelligence of their discussion is clearly greater than it was ten years ago, and that 
signifies one thing surely: they have learned to read more intelligently. 
This group has kept together for ten years now. So tar as I can see, they plan to continue 
indefinitely, increasing the scope of their reading, and rereading some of the books they 
did poorly by in the earlier years. I may have helped them by leading their discussions, 
but I am sure they could now go on without my help. In fact, I am sure they would. 
They have discovered the difference it makes in their lives. 
They were all friends before they started, but now their friendships have matured 
intellectually. Conversation now flourishes where before it might soon languish and 
give way to other things. They have experienced the pleasure of talking about serious 
problems intelligently. They do not exchange opinions as they would the time of day. 
Discussion has become responsible. A man must support what he says. Ideas have 
connections with one another and with the world of everyday affairs. They have learned 
to judge propositions and arguments by their intelligibility and relevance. 
Several years before I went to Chicago, we had started a similar adult-education 
program in New York. Mr. Bu-chanan was then assistant director of the People's 
Institute, and he and I persuaded Mr. Everett Dean Martin to let us try reading the great 
books with groups of adults. We were proposing what was then a wild experiment in 
adult education. It is not an experiment any longer. We should not have thought it was 
one then, if we had remembered the facts of European history. The discussion of 
important problems has always been the way adults continue their education, and it has 
seldom taken place except against the common background provided by reading 
important books. 
We started about ten groups all around the New York area. They met in libraries, 
gymnasiums, church social halls, and Y.M.CA.'s. They consisted of all sorts of people-
some who had been to college, some who had not, rich and poor, dull and brilliant. The 
leaders of these groups were young men most of whom had not read the books 
themselves but were willing to try. Their chief function was to conduct the discussion, 
to start it off by asking some leading questions, to keep it going when it bogged down, 
to clarify disputes when they threatened to becloud the real issues. 
It was a great success. It stopped only because it needed financial support it did not get 
to pay for staff and maintenance. But it can be revived anywhere and any time by any 
group of people who decide they will read and talk about the great books together. All 
you need are some friends to begin with, and you will be better friends before you are 
through. 
You may say that I have forgotten one thing. In both the New York and Chicago groups 
I have described, there were leaders responsible for conducting the discussion, leaders 
who may have had a little more experience than the rest of the group in reading the 
books. Trained leaders would help you get started, I admit. But they are a luxury, not a 
necessity. 

You can proceed in the most democratic fashion by electing a leader for each meeting. 
Let different people take turns at it. On each occasion the leader will probably leam 
more about reading and discussing the book than all the others. If every member of the 
group gets this experience in turn, the whole group will leam more quickly than if they 
imported a leader from the outside. There is this compensation in the plan I am 
suggesting, though it may be more difficult at the start. 
I do not have to tell you how a book should be discussed. All the rules for reading tell 
you that. They are a set of directions for discussing a book as well as reading it. Just as 
they should regulate the conversation you have with the author, so they govern the 
conversation you can have with your friends about the book. And, as I have said before, 
the two conversations mutually support each other. 
A discussion is led by the asking of questions. The rules for reading indicate the major 
questions which can be asked about any book, in itself or in relation to other books. The 
discussion is sustained by the answering of questions. Those who participate must, of 
course, understand the questions and be relevant in the remarks they make. But if you 
have acquired the discipline of coming to terms with an author, you and your friends 
should have no difficulty in coming to terms with each other. In fact, it is easier, 
because you can help one another reach an understanding. I am supposing, of course, 
that you will have good intellectual manners, that you will not judge until you 
understand what the other fellow is saying, and that when you do judge, you will give 
reasons. 
Every good conversation is a unique thing. It has never happened that way before and 
will never happen again, The order ot the questions will be different in every case. 
The opinions expressed, the way they are opposed and clarified, will vary from book to 
book and from group to group discussing the same book. Yet every good discussion is 
the same in some respects. It moves freely. The argument is followed wherever it leads. 
Understanding and agreement are the constant goals, to be reached by infinitely various 
routes. A good conversation is neither aimless nor empty. When something worth 
discussing has been well discussed, discussion is not the stale and unprofitable thing 
most people think it is. 
Good discussion of important problems in the light of great books is almost a complete 
exercise in the arts of thinking and communicating. Only writing is left out. Bacon said: 
"Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man." 
Perhaps even exactitude can be attained through the precision which well-regulated 
discussion demands. In any case, the mind can be sufficiently disciplined by reading, 
listening, and talking. 
 - 3 - 
The mind which is trained to read well has its analytical and critical powers developed. 
The mind which is trained to discuss well has them further sharpened. One acquires a 
tolerance for arguments through dealing with them patiently and sympathetically. The 
animal impulse to impose our opinions upon others is thus checked. We learn that the 
only authority is reason itself！the only arbiters in any dispute are the reasons and 
evidences. We do not try to gain ascendancy by a show of force or by counting the 
noses of those who agree with us. Genuine issues cannot be decided by the mere weight 
of opinion. We must appeal to reason, not depend on pressure groups. 

We all want to learn to think straight. A great book may help us by the examples it 
affords of penetrating insight and cogent analysis. A good discussion may give further 
support by catching us when we are thinking crooked. If our friends do not let us get 
away with it, we may soon learn that sloppy thinking, like murder, will always out. 
Embarrassment may reduce us to making an effort we had never supposed was within 
our power. Unless reading and discussion enforce these demands for straight and clear 
thinking, most of us go through life with an amazingly false confidence in our 
perceptions and judgments. We think badly most of the time and, what is worse, we do 
not know it because we are seldom found out. 
Those who can read well, listen and talk well, have disciplined minds. Discipline is 
indispensable for a free use of our powers. The man who has not the knack of doing 
something gets tied up in knots when he tries to perform. The discipline which comes 
from skill is necessary for facility. How far can you go in discussing a book with 
someone who does not know how to read or talk about it? How far can you get in your 
own reading without a trained ability? 
Discipline, as I have said before, is a source of freedom. Only a trained intelligence can 
think freely. And where there is no freedom in thinking, there can be no freedom of 
thought. Without free minds, we cannot long remain free men. 
Perhaps you are now prepared to admit that learning to read may be significantly related 
to other things！in fact, to all the rest of a reader's life. Its social and political 
implications are not remote. Before I consider them, however, let me remind you of one 
immediate justification for bothering to learn to read. 
Reading！and with it thinking and learning！is enjoyable for those who do it well. Just 
as we enjoy being able to use our bodies skillfully, so we can derive pleasure from a 
competent employment of our other faculties. The better we can use our minds, the 
more we appreciate how good it is to be able to think and learn. The art of reading can 
be praised, therefore, as intrinsically good. We have mental powers to use and leisure in 
which to employ them disinterestedly. Reading is certainly one way of fulfilling them. 
If such praise were all, I should not be satisfied. However good reading may be as an 
immediate source of pleas-nre, it is not completely an end in itself. We must do more 
than think and learn in order to lead a human life. We must act. If we wish to preserve 
our leisure for disinterested activities, we cannot shirk our practical responsibilities. It is 
in relation to our practical life that reading has its ultimate justification. 
Reading the great books has been for nought unless we are concerned with bringing 
about a good society. Everyone wants to live in it, but few seem willing to work for it. 
Let me say briefly what I mean by a good society. It is simply the enlargement of the 
community in which we live with our friends. We live together with our friends in 
peaceful and intelligent association. We form a community to the extent that we 
communicate, share common ideas and purposes. The good society, in the large, must 
be an association of men made friends by intelligent communication. 
 - 4 - 
Where men lack the arts of communication, intelligent discussion must languish. Where 
there is no mastery of the medium for exchanging ideas, ideas cease to play a part in 
human life. When that happens, men are little better than the brutes they dominate by 
force or cunning, and they will soon try to dominate each other in the same way. 

The loss of freedom follows. When men cannot live together as friends, when a whole 
society is not built on a real community of understanding, freedom cannot flourish. We 
can live freely only with our friends. With all others, we are constantly oppressed by 
every sort of dread, and checked in every movement by suspicion. 
Preserving freedom, for ourselves and our posterity, is one of our major concerns today. 
A proper respect for liberty is the heart of sound liberalism. But I cannot help 
wondering whether our liberalism is sound. We do not seem to know the origins of 
liberty or its ends. We cry out for all sorts of liberty！freedom of speech, of the press, 
of assembly！but we do not seem to realize that freedom of thought is the basis for all 
these others. Without it, freedom of speech is an empty privilege, and a free conscience 
nothing but a private prejudice. Without it, our civil liberties can be exercised only in a 
pro forma way, and we are unlikely to retain them long if we do not know how to use 
them well. 
As President Barr, of St. John's College, has pointed out, American liberalism today 
asks for too little, not too much. We have not demanded, as our ancestors did, a mind 
freed from ignorance, an awakened imagination, and a disciplined reason, without 
which we cannot effectively use our other freedoms or even preserve them. We have 
paid attention to the external uses of liberty rather than its essence. The reigning 
educational system suggests, moreover, that we no longer know how free minds are 
made and, through them, free men. 
It is not just a play on words to connect liberalism and liberal education, or to say that 
training in the liberal arts liberalizes！ makes us free. The arts of reading and writing, 
listening and speaking, are the arts which make it possible for us to think freely, because 
they discipline the mind. They are the liberating arts. The discipline they accomplish 
frees us from the vagaries of unfounded opinion and the strictures of local prejudice. 
They free our minds from every domination except the authority of reason itself. A free 
man recognizes no other authority. Those who ask to be free from all authority！from 
reason itself！are false liberals. As Milton said, "license they mean, when they cry 
liberty." 
I was invited last year by the American Council 6n Education to address its annual 
meeting in Washington. I chose to speak about the political implications of the three 
R's, under the title "Liberalism and Liberal Education." I tried to show how false 
liberalism is the enemy of liberal education, and why a truly liberal education is needed 
in this country to correct the confusions of this widely prevalent false liberalism. By 
false liberalism, I mean the sort which confuses authority with tyranny and discipline 
with regimentation. It exists wherever men think everything is just a matter of opinion. 
That is a suicidal doctrine. It ultimately reduces itself to the position that only might 
makes right. The liberal who frees himself from reason, rather than through it, 
surrenders to the only other arbiter in human affairs！force, or what Mr. Chamberlain 
has called "the awful arbitrament of war." 
The political implications of the three R's, or the liberal arts, are not far to seek. If 
democracy is a society of free men, it must sustain and extend liberal education or 
perish. Democratic citizens must be able to think for themselves. To do this, they must 
first be able to think, and have a body of ideas to think with. They must be able to 
communicate clearly with one another and receive communications of all sorts 
critically. It is for such ends that skill in reading and reading the great books are 
obviously only means. 
In Shakespeare's Henry VI, the following speech occurs: 

Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar-
school; and whereas before, our forefathers had no other books but the score and the 
tally, thou hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to the king, his crown and 
dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill. 
 
Reading and writing looked like high treason to the tyrant. He saw in them the forces 
which might shake him from his throne. And for a while they did, in the gradual 
democrati-zation of the Western world through the spread of learning and the growth of 
literacy. But we see today a different turn in human affairs. The means of 
communication which once were used by liberators to free men are now used by 
dictators to subdue them. 
Today the pen is as potent as the sword in the making of a despot. Tyrants used to be 
great generals. Now they are strategists in communication, beguiling orators or 
propagandists. Their weapons are the radio and the press, as much as secret police and 
concentration camps. And when men are pushed about by propaganda, they are as 
servile as when they are coerced by brute force. They are political puppets, not free men 
democratically ruled. 
Hobbes was suspicious of democracy because he feared its tendency to degenerate into 
an oligarchy of orators. Though our aims be different from his, we must admit that 
recent history supports his point. We have seen abroad how the leading orator in the 
land can become its tyrant. We must save democracy from these inherent weaknesses by 
closing such roads to despotism. If we are being oppressed by organizations of force, we 
fight to disarm them. So we must disarm the orators, and we must do so in advance of 
the day when their spell begins to bind. There is only one way of doing that in a land 
where free speech is everybody's privilege. The citizens must become critical of what 
they read and what they hear. They must be liberally educated. If the schools fail to give 
them such education, they must get it for themselves by learning to read and by reading. 
But, for their children's sake, they may ultimately realize that something will have to be 
done about the schools. 
The fact that liberally disciplined minds make it harder for those who try to misuse the 
means of communication is a negative point. There are positive advantages as well. A 
democracy needs both competent leaders and responsible followers. Neither is possible 
unless men can exercise free judgment and are in possession of principles which direct 
action to the right ends. A democratic citizen is an independent subject, because he is 
ultimately subject to his own free choices. A democratic leader rules only by guiding, 
not imposing upon, that freedom. 
Just as a good teacher tries to elicit active learning on the part of his students, so the art 
of ruling in a democracy is one of inviting active participation on the part of citizens. 
But just as good teaching cannot succeed unless the students have the art of being 
taught！the skills involved in learning actively from a teacher！so democratic ruling 
fails unless the citizens possess the reciprocal art of being ruled. Without the art of 
being taught, students must receive instruction passively. They can learn only through 
being indoctrinated, in the vicious sense of that word. As we have seen, we are properly 
teachable, or docile, only to the extent that we have the mental discipline to learn by the 

active and fr"e use of our powers. Similarly, without the art of being ruled, we can be 
governed only by force or imposition. 
A democracy, in short, depends on men who can rule themselves because they have the 
art of being ruled. Whether they occupy the offices of government or merely the rank of 
citizens, such men can rule or be ruled without losing their integrity or freedom. Brute 
force and insidious propaganda are evils with which they are prepared to cope. To 
maintain the reciprocity between ruling and being ruled is to guarantee political and 
civil liberty. They do not suffer because all men are not in the government or because 
just laws must be enforced. 
The art of being ruled and the reciprocal art of ruling, like the arts of being taught and of 
teaching, are arts of the mind. They are liberal arts. The democratic ruler must move us 
by rational persuasion. If we are good democratic citizens, we must be capable of being 
moved that way！and only in that way. The appeal to fact and reason distinguishes 
rational persuasion from vicious propaganda. Men who arc moved by such persuasion 
remain free because they have moved themselves. They have been persuaded 
knowingly. 
To know how to be ruled is thus the primary qualification for democratic citizenship. A 
liberal education is needed to qualify men for their political duties as well as for their 
intellectual life. The art of reading is related to the art of being ruled as well as to the art 
of being taught. In both cases, men must be able to engage in communication actively, 
intelligently, critically. Democratic government, more than any other, depends upon 
successful communication; for, as Walter Lippmann has pointed out, "in a democracy, 
the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional, but must be maintained because it 
is indispensable." The consent of the governed is fully realized only when, through 
intelligent debate of issues, all colors of political opinion share in the formation of 
decisions. Debate which is not founded on the communication of all parties is specious. 
The democratic process is a sham when men tail to understand each other. We must be 
able to meet other minds in the processes of government and social life as well as in the 
processes of learning; and, in both cases, we must be able to make up our own minds 
and act accordingly. 
We must act, however. That is the final word in every phase of human life. I have not 
hesitated to praise the reading and discussion of great books as things intrinsically good, 
but I repeat: they are not the ultimate ends of life. We want happiness and a good 
society. In this larger view, reading is only a means to an end. 
If, after you have learned to read and have read the great books, you act foolishly in 
personal or political affairs, you might just as well have saved yourself the trouble. It 
may have been fun at the time, but the fun will not last long, Unless those who are well 
read can act well also, we shall soon find ourselves deprived of the pleasures we get 
from these accomplishments. Knowledge may be a good in itself, but knowledge 
without right action will bring us to a world in which the pursuit of knowledge itself is 
impossible！a world in which books are burned, libraries closed, the search for truth is 
repressed, and disinterested leisure lost. 
I hope it is not too naive to expect the contrary from genuinely liberal education, in 
school and out. I have some reason to believe that those who have really read the great 
books will probably think well and soundly on the issues we face today. The man who 
thinks clearly about practical problems certainly knows that they are well solved only 
by right action. Whether he will respect the obligation to act accordingly is, of course, 
beyond the province of the liberal arts. Nevertheless, they prepare for freedom. They 

make free minds and form a community of friends who share a common world of ideas. 
Beyond that the responsibility for acting like free men is ours to accept or shirk.

 HOW TO READ A BOOK 
A Guide to Reading the Great Books 
by Mortimer J. Adler 
Preface 
---- 
In this special edition of How to read a Book, I can make clear what was not entirely 
clear when the book was first published in 1940. Readers of the book knew, though its 
title did not indicate this with complete accuracy, that the subject was not how to read 
any book, but how to read a great book. In 1940 the time was not yet ripe for such a 
title, with which the book might not have reached the large audience that it did. Today, 
with hundreds of thousands of American families engaged in reading and discussing the 
great gooks ！ books that alone require the kind of reading described ！ the situation is 
much changed. I have therefore added a new subtitle for this edition: A guide to Reading 
the Great Books. 
How to Read a Book attempts to inculcate skills that are useful for reading anything. 
These skills, however, are more than merely useful！they are necessary！for the 
reading of great books, those that are of enduring interest and importance. Although one 
can read books, magazines, and newspapers of transient interest without these skills, the 
possession of them enables the reader to read even the transient with greater speed, 
precision, and discrimination. The are of reading analytically, interpretively, and 
critically is indispensable only for the kind of reading by which the mind passes form a 
state of understanding less to a state of understanding more, and for reading the few 
books that are capable of being read with increasing profit over and over again. those 
few books are the great books！and the rules of reading here set forth are the rules for 
reading them. The illustrations that I have given to guide the reader in applying the rules 
all refer to the great books. 
When this book was written, it was based on twenty years of experience in reading and 
discussing the great books！at Columbia University, at the University of Chicago, and 
St. John's College in Annapolis, as well as with a number of adult groups. Since then the 
number of adult groups has multiplied by the thousands; since then many more colleges 
and universities, as well as secondary schools all over the country, have introduced 
courses devoted to reading and discussing the great books, for they have come to be 
recognized as the core of a liberal and humanistic education. But, though these are all 
advances in American education for which we have good reason to be grateful, the most 
important educational event since 1940 has been, in my judgment, the publication and 
distribution by Encyclopedia Britanica, Incorporated, of Great Books of the Western 
World, which has brought the great books into hundreds of thousands of American 
homes, and into almost every public and school library. 
To celebrate the fact, this new edition of How to Read a Book carries a new Appendix 
that lists the contents of Great Books of the Western World; and also, accordingly, a 
revised version of Chapter Sixteen. Turn to page 373 and you will find the great books 
listed there into four main groups: imaginative literature (poetry, fiction, and drama); 
history and social science; natural science and mathematics; philosophy and theology. 
Since 1952, when Great Books of the Western World was published, Encyclopedia 
Britannica has added a companion set of books, consisting of shorter masterpieces in all 
fields of literature and learning, properly entitled Gateway to the Great Books. You will 
find the contents of this set also listed in the Appendix, beginning on page 379. 
The present book is, as its subtitle indicates, a guide to reading the things that most 
deserve careful reading and rereading, and that is why I recommend it to anyone who 
owns Great Books of the Western World and Gateway to the Great Books. But the 

owner of these sets has other tools at hand to help him. The Syntopicon, comprising 
Volumes 2 and 3 of Great Books of the Western World, is a different kind of guide to 
reading. How to Read a Book is intended to help the reader read a single great book 
through cover to cover. The Syntopicon helps the reader read through the whole 
collection of great books by reading what they have to say on any one of three thousand 
topics of general human interest, organized under 102 great ideas. (You will find the 
102 great ideas listed on the jacket of this book.) Volume I of Gateway to the Great 
Books contains a Syntopical Guide that serves a similar purpose for that set of shorter 
masterpieces. 
One other Britannica publication deserves brief mention here. Unlike each year's best-
sellers that are out of date one year later, the great books are the perennials of 
literature！relevant to the problems that human beings face in every year of every 
century. That is the way they should be read！for the light they throw upon human life 
and human society, past, present, and future. And that is why Britannica publishes an 
annual volume, entitled The Great Ideas Today, the aim of which is to illustrate the 
striking relevance of the great books and the great ideas to contemporary events and 
issues, and to the latest advances in the arts and sciences. 
With all these aids to reading and to understanding, the accumulated wisdom of our 
Western civilization is within the reach of anyone who has the willingness to put them 
to good use.

PART I . 
 
THE ACTIVITY OF READING 
 
 CHAPTER ONE 
To the Average Reader 
 - 1 - 
This is a book for readers who cannot read. They may sound rude, though I do not mean 
to be. It may sound like a contradiction, but it is not. The appearance of rudeness and 
contradiction arises only from the variety of senses in which the word "reading" can be 
used. 
The reader who has read thus far surely can read, in some sense of the word. You can 
guess, therefore, what I must mean. It is that this book is intended for those who can 
read in some sense of "reading" but not in others. There are many kinds of reading and 
degrees of ability to read. It is not contradictory to say that this book is for readers who 
want to read better or want to read in some other way than they now can. 
For whom is this book not intended, then? I can answer that question simply by naming 
the two extreme cases. There are those who cannot read at all or in any way.: Infants, 
imbeciles, and other innocents. And there may be those who are masters of the art of 
reading！who can do every sort of reading and do it as well as is humanly possible. 
Most authors would like nothing better than such persons to write for. But a book, such 
as this, which is concerned with the art of reading itself and which aims to help its 
readers read better, cannot solicit the attention of the already expert. 
Between these two extremes we find the average reader, and that means most of us who 
have learned our ABC's. We have been started on the road to literacy. But most of us 
also know that we are not expert readers. We know this in many ways, but most 
obviously when we find from some things too difficult to read, or have great trouble in 
reading them; or when someone else has read the same thing we have and shown us 
how much we missed or misunderstood. 
If you have not had experiences of this sort, if you have never felt the effort of reading 
or known the frustration when all the effort you could summon was not equal to the 
task, I do not know how to interest you in the problem. Most of us, however, have 
experienced difficulties in reading, but we do not know why we have trouble or what to 
do about it. 
I think this is because most of us do not regard reading as a complicated activity, 
involving many different steps in each of which we can acquire more and more skill 
through practice, as in the case of any other art. We may not even think there is an art of 
reading. We tend to think of reading almost as if it were something as simple and 
natural to do as looking or walking. There is no art of looking or walking. 
Last summer, while I was writing this book, a young man visited me, He had heard 
what I was doing, and he came to ask a favor. Would I tell him how to improve his 
reading? He obviously expected me to answer the question in a few sentences. More 

than that, he appeared to think that once he had learned the simple prescription, success 
would be just around the corner. 
I tried to explain that it was not so simple. It took many pages of this book, I said, to 
discuss the various rules of reading and to show how they should be followed. I told 
him that this book was like a book how to play tennis. As written about in books, the art 
of tennis consists of rules for manage each of the various strokes, a discussion of how 
and when to use them, and a description of how to organize these parts into the general 
strategy of a successful game. The art of reading has to be written about in the same 
way. There are rules for each of the different steps you must take to complete the 
reading of a whole book. 
He seemed a little dubious. Although he suspected that he did not know how to read, he 
also seemed to feel that there could not be so much to learn. The young man was a 
musician. I asked him whether most people, who can hear the sounds, know how to 
listen to a symphony. His reply was, of course not. I confessed I was one of them, and 
asked whether he could tell me how to listen to music as a musician expected it to he 
heard. Of course he could, but not in a few words. Listening to a symphony was a 
complicated affair. You not only had to keep awake, but there were so many different 
things to attend to, so many parts of it to distinguish and relate. He could not tell me 
briefly all that I would have to know. Furthermore, I would have to spend a lot of time 
listening to music to become a skilled auditor. 
Well, I said, the case of reading was similar, If I could learn to hear music, he could 
learn to read a book, but only on the same conditions. Knowing how to read a book well 
was like any other art or skill. There were rules to learn and to follow. Through practice 
good habits must be formed. There were no insurmountable difficulties about it. Only 
willingness to learn and patience in the process were required. 
I do not know whether my answer fully satisfied him. If it didn't, there was one 
difficulty in the way of his learning to read. He did not yet appreciate what reading 
involved. Because he still regarded reading as something almost anyone can do, 
something learned in the primary grades, he may have doubted still that learning to read 
was just like learning to hear music, to play tennis, or become expert in any other 
complex use of one's senses and one's mind. 
The difficulty is, I fear, one that most of us share. That is why I am going to devote the 
first part of this book to explaining the kind of activity reading is. For unless you 
appreciate what is involved, you will not be prepared (as this young man was not when 
he came to see me) for the kind of instruction that is necessary. 
I shall assume, of course, that you want to learn. My help can go no further than you 
will help yourself. No one can make you learn more of an art than you want to learn or 
think you need. People often say that they would try to read if they only knew how. As a 
matter of fact, they might learn how if they would only try. And try they would, if they 
wanted to learn. 
 - 2 - 
I did not discover I could not read until after I had left college. I found it out only after I 
tried to teach others how to read. Most parents have probably made a similar discovery 
by trying to teach their youngsters. Paradoxically, as a result, the parents usually learn 
more about reading than their children. The reason is simple. They have to be more 
active about the business. Anyone who teaches anything has to. 

To get back to my story. So far as the registrar's records were concerned, I was one of 
the satisfactory students in my day at Columbia. We passed courses with creditable 
marks. The game was easy enough, once you caught on to the tricks. If anyone had told 
us then that we did not know much or could not read very well, we would have been 
shocked. We were sure we could listen to lectures and read the books assigned in such 
a way we could answer examination questions neatly. That was the proof of our ability. 
Some of us took one course which increased our self-satisfaction enormously. I had just 
been started by John Erskine. It ran for two years, was called General Honors, and was 
open to a select group of juniors and seniors. It consisted of nothing but "reading" the 
great books, from the Greek classics through the Latin and medieval masterpieces right 
down to the best books of yesterday, William James, Einstein, and Freud. The books 
were in all fields: they were histories and books of science or philosophy, dramatic 
poetry and novels. We discussed them with our teachers one night a week in informal, 
seminar fashion. 
That course had two effects on me. For one thing, it made me think I had struck 
educational gold for the first time. Here was real stuff, handled in a real way, compared 
to the textbook and lecture courses that merely made demands on one's memory. But the 
trouble was I not only thought I had struck gold; I also thought that I owned the mine. 
Here were the great books. I knew how to read. The world was my oyster. 
If, after graduation, I had gone into business or medicine or law, I would probably still 
be harboring the conceit that I knew how to read and was well read beyond the ordinary. 
Fortunately, something woke me form this dream. For every illusion that the classroom 
can nourish, there is a school of hard knocks to destroy it. A few years of practice 
awaken the lawyer and the doctor. Business or newspaper work disillusions the boy who 
thought he was a trader or a reporter when he finished the school of commerce or 
journalism. Well, I thought I was liberally educated, that I knew how to read, and had 
read a lot. The cure for that was teaching, and the punishment that precisely fitted my 
crime was to having to teach, the year after I graduated, in this very Honors course 
which had so inflated me. 
As a student, I had read all the books I was now going to teach but, being very young 
and conscientious, I decided to read them again- you know, just to brush up each week 
for class. To my growing amazement, week after week, I discovered that the books were 
almost brand new to me. I seemed to be reading them for the first time, these books 
which I thought I had "mastered" thoroughly. 
As time went on, I found out not only that I did not know very much about any of these 
books, but also that I did not know how to read them very well. To make up for my 
ignorance and incompetence I did what any young teacher might do who was afraid of 
both his students and his job. I used secondary sources, encyclopedias, commentaries, 
all sorts of books about books about these books. In that way, I thought, I would appear 
to know more than the students. They wouldn't be able to tell that my questions or 
points did not come from my better reading of the book they too were working on. 
Fortunately for me I was found out, or else I might have been satisfied with getting by 
as a teaching just as I had got by as a student. If I had succeeded in fooling others, I 
might soon have deceived myself as well. My first good fortune was in having as a 
colleague in this teaching Mark Van Doren, the poet. He led off in the discussion of 
poetry, as I was supposed to do in the case of history, science, and philosophy. He was 
several years my senior, probably more honest than I, certainly a better reader. Forced 

to compare my performance with his, I simply could not fool myself. I had not found 
out what the books contained by reading them, but by reading about them. 
My questions about a book were of the sort anyone could ask or answer without having 
read the book！anyone who had had recourse to the discussion which a hundred 
secondary sources provide for those who cannot or do not want to read. In contrast, his 
questions seemed to arise from the pages of the book itself. He actually seemed to have 
some intimacy with the author. Each book was a large world, infinitely rich for 
exploration, and woe to the student who answered questions as if, instead of traveling 
therein, he had been listening to a travelogue. The contrast was too plain, and too much 
for me. I was not allowed to forget that I did not know to read. 
My second good fortune lay in the particular group of students who formed that first 
class. They were not long in catching on to me. They knew how to use the 
encyclopedia, or a commentary, or the editor's introduction which usually graces the 
publication of a classic, just as well as I did. One of them, who has since achieved fame 
as a critic, was particularly obstreperous. He took what seemed to me endless delight in 
discussing the various about the book, which could be obtained from secondary sources, 
always to show me and the rest of the class that the book itself still remained to be 
discussed. I do not mean that he or the other students could read the book better than I, 
or had done so. Clearly none of us, with the exception of Mr. Van Doren, was doing the 
job of reading. 
After the first year of teaching, I had few illusions left about my literacy. Since then, I 
have been teaching students how to read books, six years at Columbia with Mark Van 
Doren and for the last ten years at the University of Chicago with President Robert M. 
Hutchins. In the course of years, I think I have gradually learned to read a little better. 
There is no longer any danger of self-deception, of supposing that I have become expert. 
Why? Because reading the same books year after year, I discover each time what I 
found out the first year I began to teach: the book I am rereading is almost new to me. 
For a while, each time I reread it, that I had really read it well at last, only to have the 
next reading show up my inadequacies and misinterpretations. After this happens 
several times, even the dullest of us is likely to learn that perfect reading lies at the end 
of the rainbow. Although practice makes perfect, in this art of reading as in any other, 
the long run needed to prove the maxim is longer than the allotted span. 
 - 3 - 
I am torn between two impulses. I certainly want to encourage you to undertake this 
business of learning to read, but I do not want to fool you by saying that it is quite easy 
or that it can be done in a short time. I am sure you do not want to be fooled. As in the 
case of every other skill, learning to read well presents difficulties to be overcome by 
effort and time. Anyone who undertakes anything is prepared for that, I think, and 
knows that the achievement seldom exceeds the effort. After all, it takes time and 
trouble to grow up from the cradle, to make a fortune, raise a family, or gain the wisdom 
that some old men have. Why should it not take time and trouble to learn to read and to 
read what is worth reading? 
Of course, it would not take so long if we got started when we were in school. 
Unfortunately, almost the opposite happens: one gets stopped. I shall discuss the failure 
of the schools more fully later. Here I wish only to record this fact about our schools, a 
fact which concerns us all, because in large part they have made us what we are today！
people who cannot read well enough to enjoy reading for profit or profit by reading for 
emjoyment. 

But education does not stop with schooling, nor does the responsibility for the ultimate 
educatiional fate of each of us rest entirely on the school system. Everyone can and 
must decide for himself whether he is satisfied with the education he got, or is now 
getting if he is still in school. If he is not satisfied, it is up to him to do something about 
it. With schools as they are, more schooling is hardly the remedy. One weay out！
perhaps the onlyone available to most people！is to learn to read better, and then, by 
reading better, to learn more of what can be learned through reading. 
The way out and how to take it is what this book tries to show. It is for adults who have 
gradually become aware of how little they got from all their schooling, as well as for 
those who, lacking such opportunities, have been puzzled to know how to overcome a 
derprivation they need not to regret too much. It is for student in shool and college who 
may occasionally wonder how to help themselves to education. It is even for teachers 
who may sometimes realize that they are not giving all the help they should, and that 
maybe they do not know how. 
When I think of this large potential audience as the average reader, I am not neglecting 
all the differences in training and ability, in schooling or experience, and certainly not 
the different degrees of interest or sorts of motivation which can be brought to this 
common task. But what is of primary importance is that all of us share a recognition of 
the task and its worth. 
We may be engaged in occupations which do not require us to read for a living, but we 
may still feel that that living would be graded, in its moments of leisure, by some 
learning！the sort we can do by ourselves through reading. We may be professionally 
occupied with matters that demand a kind of technical reading in the course of our 
work: the physician has to keep up with the medical literature; the lawyer never stops 
reading cases; the businessman has to read financial statements, insurance policies, 
contracts, and so forth. No matter whether the reading is to learn or to earn, it can be 
done poorly or well. 
We may be college students！perhaps candidates for a higher degree！and yet realize 
that what is happening to us is stuffing, not education. There are many college students 
who know, certainly by the time they get their bachelor's degree, that they spent four 
years taking courses and finishing with them by passing examinations. The mastery 
attained in that process is not of subject matter, but of the teacher's personality. If the 
student remembers enough of what was told to him in lectures and textbooks, and if he 
has a line on the teacher's pet prejudices, he can pass the course easily enough. but he is 
also passing up an education. 
We may be teachers in some school, college, or university. I hope that most of us 
teachers know we are not expert readers. I hope we know, not merely that our students 
can not read well, but also that we cannot do much better. Every profession has a certain 
amount of humbug about it necessary for impressing the laymen or the clients to be 
served. The humbug we teachers have to practice is the front we put on of knowledge 
and expertness. It is not entirely humbug, because we usually know a little more and can 
do a little better than our best students. But we must not let the humbug fool ourselves. 
If we do not know that our students cannot read very well, we are worse than humbugs: 
we do not our business at all. And if we do not know that we cannot read very much 
better than they, we have allowed our professional imposture to deceive ourselves. 
Just as the best doctors are those who can somehow retain the patient's confidence not 
by hiding but by confessing their limitations, so the best teachers are those who make 
the fewest pretensions. If the students are on all fours with a difficult problem, the 

teacher who shows that he is only crawling also, helps them much more than the 
pedagogue who appears to fly in maginficient circles far above their heads.Perhaps, if 
we teachers were more honest about our own reading disabilities, less loath to reveal 
how hard it is for us to read and how often we fumble, we might get the students interest 
in the game of learning instead of the game of passing. 
 - 4 - 
I trust I have said enough to indicate to readers who cannot read that I am one who 
cannot read much better than they. My chief advantage is the clarity with which I know 
that I cannot, and perhaps why I cannot. That is the best fruit of years of experience in 
trying to teach others. Of course, if I am just a little better than someone else, I can help 
him somewhat. Although none of us can read well enough to satisfy ourselves, we may 
be able to read better than someone else. Although few of us read well for the most 
part, each of us may do a good job of reading in some particular connection, when the 
stakes are high enough to compel the rare exertion. 
The student who is generally superficial may, for a special reason, read some one thing 
well. Scholars who are as superficial as the rest of us in most of their reading often do a 
careful job when the text is in their own narrow field, especially if their reputations hang 
on what they say. On cases relevant to his practice, a lawyer is likely to read 
analytically. A physician may similarly read clinical reports which describe symptoms 
he is currently concerned with. But both these learned men may make similar effort in 
other fields or at other times. Even business assumes the air of a learned profession 
when its devotees are called upon to examine financial statements or contracts, though I 
have heard it said that many businessmen cannot read these documents intelligently 
even when their fortunes are at stake. 
If we consider men and women generally, and apart from their professions or 
occupations, there is only one situation I can think of in which they almost pull 
themselves up by their bootstraps, making an effort to read better than they usually do. 
When they are in love and are reading a love letter, they read between the lines and in 
the margins; they read the whole in terms of the parts, and each part in terms of the 
whole; they grow sensitive to context and ambiguity, to insinuation and implication; 
they perceive the color of words, the odor of phrases, and the weight of sentences.They 
may even take the punctuation into account. Then, if never before or after, they read. 
These examples, especially the last, are enough to suggest a first approximation of what 
I mean by "reading." That is not enough, however. What this is all about can be more 
accurately understood only if the different kinds and grades of reading are more 
definitely distinguished. To read this book intelligently！which is what this book aims 
to help its readers do with all books！such distinctions must be grasped. that belongs to 
the next chapter. Here suffice it if it is understood that this book is not about reading in 
every sense but only about that kind of reading which its readers do not do well enough, 
or at all, except when they are in love 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER TWO 
The Reading of "Reading" 
 - 1 - 
 One of the primary rules for reading anything is to spot the most important words the 
author uses. Spotting them is not enough, however. You have to know how they are 
being used. Finding an important word merely begins the more difficult research for the 
meanings, one or more, common or special, which the word is used to convey as it 
appears here and there in the text. 
You already know "reading" is one of the most important words in this book. But, as I 
have already sugggested, it is a word of many meanings. If you take for granted that you 
know what I mean by the word, we are likely to get into difficulties before we proceed 
much further. 
This business of using language to talk about language！specially if one is campaigning 
against its abuse！is risky. Recently Mr. Stuart Chase wrote a book which he should 
have called Words bout Words. He might then have avoided the barb of the critics who 
so quickly pointed out that Mr. Chase himself was subject to the tyranny of word. Mr. 
Chase recognized the peril when he said , "I shall frequently be caught in my own trap 
by using bad language in a plea for better." 
Can I avoid such pitfalls? I am writing about reading and so it would appear that I do 
not have to obey the rules of reading but of writing. My escape may be more apparrent 
than real, if it turns out that a writer should keep in mind the rules which govern 
reading. You, however, are reading about reading. You cannot escape. If the reules of 
reading I am going to suggest are sound, you must follow them in reading this book. 
But, you will say, how can we follow the rules until we learn and understand them? To 
do that we shall have to read some part of this book without knowing what the rules are. 
The only way I know to help out of this dilemma is by making you reading-conscious 
readers as we proceed. Let us start at once by applying the rule about find and 
interpreting the important words. 
 - 2 - 
When you start out to investigate the various senses of a word, it is usually wise to 
begin with a dictionary and your own knowledge of common usage. If you looked up 
"read" in the large Oxford Dictionary, you would find, first, that the same four letters 
constituted an obsolete noun referring to the fourth stomach of a ruminant, and the 
commonly used verb which refers to a mental activity involving words or symbols of 
some sort. You would know at once that we need not bother with the obsolete noun 
except, perhaps, to note that reading has something to do with rumination. You would 
discover next that the verb has twenty-one more or less closely related meanings, more 
or less common. 
One uncommon meaning of "to read" is to think or suppose. This meaning passes into 
the more usual one of conjecturing or predicting, as when we speak of reading the stars, 
one's prm, or one's future. That leads eventually to the meaning of the word in which it 
refers to perusing books or other written documents. There are many other meanings, 
such as verbal utterance ( when an actress reads her lines for the director); such as 
detecting what is not perceptible from what is (when we asy we can read a person's 

character in his face); such as instruction, academic or personal (when we have someone 
read us a lecture). 
The slight variations in usage seem endless; a singer reads music; a scientist reads 
nature; an engineer reads his instruments; a printer reads proof; we read between the 
lines; we read something into situation, or someone out of the party. 
We can simplify matters by noting what is common to many of these senses; namely, 
that mental activity is involved and that, in one way or another, symbols are being 
interpreted. That imposes a first limitation on our use of the word. We are not concerned 
with a part of the intestinal tract, nor are we concerned with enunciation, with speaking 
something out loud. A second limitation is need, because we shall not consider！except 
for some points of comparison！the interpretation, clairvoyant or otherwise, of natural 
signs such as stars hands, or faces. We shall limit ourselves to one kind
